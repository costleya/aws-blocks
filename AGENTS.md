# AGENTS.md — AWS Blocks (contributor guide)

> **AWS Blocks** is an Infrastructure-from-Code TypeScript monorepo. One `aws-blocks/` directory defines an entire backend; each **Building Block (BB)** bundles a CDK construct + an AWS-runtime SDK client + a local mock behind one strongly-typed API. Frontends import the backend's types directly — no client generation step. Everything runs locally with no AWS account; deploy with `cdk deploy`.

## How to work here
You're an engineer working **on AWS Blocks itself** — the framework and its Building Blocks. (If the task is building an app *with* AWS Blocks, this is the wrong doc → run `npm create @aws-blocks/blocks-app@latest my-app`.) You serve the project, its users, and its maintainers — not only the request in front of you.

- **Default to making the change** — implement it, don't just describe it.
- **Definition of done = the "Before you open a PR" checklist passes** (build, lint, tests, changeset, docs).
- **Stay inside Building Blocks** for anything they cover; reach for the escape hatch (raw CDK construct / AWS SDK / `RawRoute`) only when no BB fits.
- **Stop and ask** before any breaking change — changed return types, narrowed unions, removed exports, a changed export map, or a changed on-disk format — and surface it for maintainer review.
- If a task isn't covered here, **say so** rather than guessing — your operator may have pointed you at the wrong tool.

## Personal integration branch

`my-main` is the personal integration branch for local fixes that have not yet landed upstream. Keep upstream `main`
clean and usable as the comparison base. Create each patch worktree and feature branch from `my-main`, complete the
normal AWS Blocks verification there, then merge the verified branch back into `my-main`. Do not push any branch
unless the user explicitly authorizes that push in the current turn.

## Code navigation and editing

Use semantic tools when they are available, but keep the lookup proportional to the question:

- Unknown behavior, package, flow, or impact area: use GrepAI first.
- Known file but unknown symbol: use Serena's symbol overview, then inspect the relevant symbol.
- Known symbol: use Serena symbol lookup; use Serena references for callers and refactor scope.
- Literal strings, errors, configuration keys, scripts, filenames, generated files, and non-code files: use `rg` and
  targeted reads.
- If a semantic request fails, correct it and retry before falling back to a broad source read.
- Prefer symbol-scoped edits for code already inspected through Serena. Use `apply_patch` for imports, constants,
  cross-region wiring, and non-code files. Regenerate generated files with their owning scripts.

When a change can cross a runtime boundary, inspect the mock, aws-runtime, cdk, browser, declaration, and generated
API-report surfaces rather than assuming one implementation represents the public contract.

## Subagent orchestration

Use the main thread as coordinator, synthesis owner, and final acceptance owner. For non-trivial work, delegate
independent repository discovery, external research, production changes, test changes, integrated verification, and
review when those scopes have stable boundaries. Handle genuinely small, single-owner work directly.

| Role | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `repo_explorer` | Unfamiliar repository behavior, package relationships, risks, and likely edit surfaces. |
| `researcher` | Current external documentation, AWS guidance, regional availability, and source-backed decisions. |
| `repo_implementer` | Production code and substantial framework or infrastructure changes. |
| `test_implementer` | `node:test`, parity, CDK, and comprehensive E2E coverage without production edits. |
| `test_runner` | Post-integration command execution and evidence after every writer finishes. |
| `code_reviewer` | Independent review of an explicit risk domain before acceptance. |

Workflow rules:

1. Give every assignment an outcome, acceptance criteria, public contract, owned files or symbols, constraints, and
   expected evidence. Use `fork_turns = "none"` with a self-contained prompt for configured specialist roles.
2. Use multiple agents only for stable, non-overlapping scopes. No two writers own the same file or symbol unless
   the assignment explicitly requests competing alternatives.
3. For a bug, sequence the work: a `test_implementer` first adds and confirms the failing repro, then a
   `repo_implementer` makes it green. Prefer comprehensive E2E for customer-visible bugs and package tests for
   internal behavior.
4. For a feature with stable contracts, production and tests may be written in parallel. If the contract is
   unsettled, establish it before assigning tests.
5. Do not duplicate an active owner's work or interrupt merely because progress is not yet visible. Return review,
   lint, formatting, build, and focused-test fallout to that owner with `followup_task`; it remains unfinished work.
6. Wait for every writer before final verification. Use one `test_runner` for the integrated gate; it reports defects
   and does not repair them.
7. Send non-trivial integrated changes to one `code_reviewer` by default. Add another reviewer only for a clearly
   disjoint risk domain. Route corrections back to the same reviewer for confirmation.
8. The main thread owns long-lived server and sandbox lifecycle. Follow the tmux pattern below, and always destroy a
   deployed sandbox plus verify deletion before finishing.

---

## 🚦 Core rules (these gate a PR)

1. CDK synth must run with **`--conditions=cdk`**. Without it, BBs load their mocks and synth produces no infrastructure.
2. Persist application state **only through Building Blocks** — no local files, in-memory arrays, or ad-hoc databases. Without this → state vanishes on deploy (Lambda is stateless) or diverges between local dev and AWS.
3. Inject BB config with **`registerConfig()`**, never `handler.addEnvironment()` (Lambda env has a ~4 KB cap).
4. Call BB data methods **only inside request/job handlers** — never at module top level or during synth (the CDK class stubs them with `synthGuard` to throw).
5. **Never attach `Error.cause` enumerably** — it leaks SDK metadata (`$metadata`, ARNs) when an error is serialized to the client.
6. Errors cross the wire by **`name`, not `code`** — match with `isBlocksError(e, SomeErrors.Foo)` (works the same server- and client-side).
7. **`get()`-style reads return `null`** for not-found — throw only for violated preconditions (e.g. a failed conditional write). Without this → callers need try/catch for normal control flow, and missing-item checks become invisible.
8. Keep customer-facing code cast-free: **no `as any` / `: any` / `@ts-ignore`** (a cast usually means a public type is wrong — fix the type).
9. Every API method is a public, internet-reachable RPC endpoint with no auth by default — **gate inside each method** with `await auth.requireAuth(context)`.
10. Every change to a published package **ships a changeset** covering all changed packages (its text becomes the public changelog).
11. Keep docs **runnable** — every README/JSDoc snippet, command, package name, and relative link is correct at HEAD; a dead link in a published `packages/*/README.md` is a defect. Without this → users copy-paste broken code and lose trust in the framework.
12. **No root `/` route**, and a route wildcard must be the last path segment. Violating this → API Gateway rejects the route or swallows all traffic into one handler.
13. Refer to the project as **"AWS Blocks"** (no article — "built with AWS Blocks"). Inconsistent naming → confuses search, docs, and brand recognition.

## Architecture in 60 seconds

**Conditional exports** swap the implementation per environment. Every BB `package.json`:
```jsonc
"type": "module",
"exports": { ".": {
  "browser":     "./dist/index.browser.js",   // browser stub
  "cdk":         { "types": "./dist/index.cdk.d.ts", "default": "./dist/index.cdk.js" },
  "aws-runtime": "./dist/index.aws.js",        // Lambda runtime (--conditions=aws-runtime)
  "types":       "./dist/index.mock.d.ts",     // ← types resolve to the MOCK
  "default":     "./dist/index.mock.js"        // ← local dev + tests
}}
```
- `Scope` is the namespace + registration bus; BBs **extend** it (never wrap it) — that's how infra discovery, IAM propagation, and `fullId` computation work.
- `BlocksStack` / `BlocksBackend` anchor the infra; `ApiNamespace` turns an app's module of methods into a JSON-RPC endpoint at `POST /aws-blocks/api`. A BB doesn't auto-expose RPC — the app wraps the methods it wants to call.
- **Resource names are derived, not handed off.** Each layer computes the same deterministic name from `fullId` independently: the CDK layer provisions a resource named `fullId.substring(0,255)`; the runtime and mock layers call `registerSdkIdentifiers(this.fullId, {...})` in their constructor and resolve it with `getSdkIdentifiers(this)` **at call time** (a same-process registry, so co-located BBs can find each other). The mock uses a `mock-`-prefixed name and persists to disk. Extra (non-name) config is the only thing the CDK layer pushes to the runtime, via `registerConfig()`.
- Some BBs return **live client objects, not data** (e.g. a realtime channel). They use the **Transferable** pattern: the server value serializes (`toJSON()` → `{__blocks: …}`) and re-hydrates into a live client object via client middleware. `bb-realtime` is the canonical end-to-end example.

### Core API & glossary
| Symbol | From | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `Scope` | `@aws-blocks/core` (runtime/mock) **or** `@aws-blocks/core/cdk` (CDK) | base class every BB extends |
| `ScopeParent` | `@aws-blocks/core` (always) | the parent argument type |
| `ApiNamespace`, `ApiError`, `isBlocksError` | `@aws-blocks/core` | RPC wrapper · HTTP-mapped error · typed-error guard |
| `registerSdkIdentifiers`, `getSdkIdentifiers` | `@aws-blocks/core` | register (in mock/runtime ctor) / resolve (at call time) a BB's resource names |
| `registerConfig`, `synthGuard` | `@aws-blocks/core/cdk` | inject Lambda config at synth · `(): never` stub for runtime-only methods |
| `scope.registerClientMiddleware(pkg)` | `Scope` method (codegen) | registers the client-plugin **package specifier** that hydrates a Transferable into a live client object — the plugin does the hydration, this just registers it |
| `getMockDataDir` | `@aws-blocks/core/bb-utils` | mock persistence dir → `.bb-data/{fullId}/` |
| `auth.requireAuth(context)` | an auth BB | gate a method; returns the user or throws 401 |
| `RawRoute` | `@aws-blocks/core` | escape hatch for a raw HTTP route when JSON-RPC isn't enough |
| `fullId` | — | a BB instance's unique scoped id (drives resource + mock-data naming) |
| reference object | — | the lightweight handle `fromExisting()` returns (e.g. `{ tableName }`), passed into a constructor — not a constructed BB |
| Transferable | — | a server value that serializes (`toJSON()` → `{__blocks: …}`) and re-hydrates into a live client object via client middleware. Canonical example: `bb-realtime` |

## How an app consumes a BB (the mental model authoring serves)
```ts
// aws-blocks/index.ts — define backend + the API surface
const scope = new Scope('app');
const notes = new KVStore(scope, 'notes');
const auth  = new AuthBasic(scope, 'auth');
export const authApi = auth.createApi();                 // BB-authored state machine
export const api = new ApiNamespace(scope, 'api', (context) => ({
  async addNote(text: string) {
    const user = await auth.requireAuth(context);        // gate: methods are public by default
    await notes.put(`${user.userId}:${crypto.randomUUID()}`, text);
  },
}));

// aws-blocks/index.handler.ts — Lambda entry (lazy import so config loads first)
export const handler = createLambdaHandler(() => import('./index.js'));

// frontend — typed import of the backend, no codegen
import { api } from 'aws-blocks';
await api.addNote('hello');
```
> A method that returns a live client object (rather than plain data) returns a Transferable — see `bb-realtime`, where `getChannel()` hands the client a channel it `subscribe()`s to (server-side `publish`/`subscribe`; client-side hydration via the registered client middleware).

## 🧱 Authoring a NEW Building Block

**Reference, don't clone.** `packages/bb-kv-store/` is the canonical reference for the file structure and the conditional-export layering (`index.mock/aws/cdk/browser.ts` + `types.ts`/`errors.ts`/`version.ts`, the `Scope` subclass, `synthGuard` stubs) — read it to learn the *shape*, not to copy wholesale. Its data model is a DynamoDB key/value table; **that does not generalize.** Pick the closest-shaped BB and understand every line you carry over:

| Your BB is… | Reference | Note |
|---|---|---|
| key/value or single-table | `bb-kv-store` / `bb-distributed-table` | the typical file skeleton below |
| relational / SQL | `bb-data` (`Database`) / `bb-distributed-data` (`DistributedDatabase`) | `migrationsPath` + ordered `.sql` |
| auth / composed from other BBs (no own infra) | `bb-auth-basic` | uses `index.ts` only; exposes `createApi()` |
| background work (SQS + event source) | `bb-async-job` | `submit()` + a job handler |
| WebSocket / returns a live client object | `bb-realtime` | client hydration (Transferable) + server APIs; `index.ts`/middleware; `Symbol.for` shared per-stack infra |
| object storage | `bb-file-bucket` | `scan({prefix})` is valid here (S3 scopes natively) |

> **Two references, two purposes.** Use `bb-kv-store` to learn the **typical file layout & layering**. Use `bb-realtime` to learn the **full client↔server surface** — it's the one BB that demonstrates client-side hydration end-to-end: a server method returns a Transferable (a channel handle) that serializes via `toJSON()` and re-hydrates into a live client object through a registered client middleware, alongside server-side `publish`/`subscribe`. The data BBs only exercise the server/data side. **Don't copy `bb-realtime`'s layout** for a simple BB — it's atypical (single `index.ts`, no mock/aws/cdk split, middleware files, shared per-stack infra).
>
> Some BBs use a single `index.ts` (no `index.mock/aws/cdk.ts`) and own no CDK/AWS layer (`bb-auth-basic`, `bb-realtime`) — don't force the skeleton onto them. And **never copy a reference's package.json verbatim** — regenerate `files[]` and the `test` glob from your actual `src/` (reference scripts can be stale — e.g. one currently names a non-existent test file and omits a real one).

**Standard file shape** (`bb-kv-store`):
```
packages/bb-{name}/
  README.md            # authoritative user doc (runnable snippets, "When to use / When not")
  DESIGN.md            # internals + mock↔AWS differences (shipped per-BB convention)
  API.md               # GENERATED by api-extractor — never hand-edit
  package.json  tsconfig.json  api-extractor.json
  src/
    version.ts         # GENERATED (prebuild) — BB_NAME, BB_VERSION
    types.ts           # TYPES ONLY — `import type` only; no const/function/class
    errors.ts          # XxxErrors as-const + blocksError()
    index.mock.ts      # default + types entry
    index.aws.ts       # aws-runtime entry
    index.cdk.ts       # cdk entry
    index.browser.ts   # browser stub: re-exports types + error constants; methods are server-side (throw)
    index.test.ts  parity.test.ts  index.cdk.test.ts
```

**The non-obvious bits of the three layers:**
```ts
// index.mock.ts — local dev + tests; persists to disk; self-registers a mock name
super(id, { parent: scope, bbName: BB_NAME, bbVersion: BB_VERSION });
registerSdkIdentifiers(this.fullId, { tableName: `mock-${this.fullId}` });
this.file = join(getMockDataDir(this), 'store.json');                    // .bb-data/{fullId}/

// index.aws.ts — real SDK client; registers in ctor, resolves at call time
readonly bbName = BB_NAME;
constructor(...) { super(...); registerSdkIdentifiers(this.fullId, { tableName: /* derived */ });
                   this.client = new DynamoDBClient({ customUserAgent: this.buildUserAgentChain() }); }
async get(key: string): Promise<T | null> {
  const { tableName } = getSdkIdentifiers(this);                         // ← call time, never the ctor
  /* GetItem; return null when absent */
}

// index.cdk.ts — provisions infra; does NOT register identifiers (it derives the same name)
import { Scope, registerConfig, synthGuard } from '@aws-blocks/core/cdk';
static fromExisting(tableName: string): ExternalTableRef { return { __brand: 'ExternalTableRef', tableName }; }
constructor(...) {
  super(id, { parent: scope });                                          // no bbName/bbVersion here
  this.table = new Table(this, 'table', { tableName: this.fullId.substring(0, 255) /* … */ });
  this.table.grantReadWriteData(this.handler);                           // grant on the SHARED handler
  registerConfig(this, 'BLOCKS_THING_FLAG', '…');                        // extra config only (not addEnvironment)
}
get(..._a: unknown[]): never { return synthGuard('Thing', 'get'); }      // stub EVERY runtime method
```
> Returning a live client object? Make it a Transferable (`toJSON()` → `{__blocks: 'ns/type', …}`) and register a client plugin with `scope.registerClientMiddleware`; the mock must return a functional Transferable too. `bb-realtime` is the reference.

**Checklist for a new BB:**
- conditional exports across all entry points + `prebuild` version script
- `types.ts` types-only
- every named export in `index.mock.ts` exists in cdk/aws/browser (enforced by `conditional-exports.test.ts` in `packages/blocks`)
- ship `README.md` + `DESIGN.md` via `package.json` `"files"`
- register in the umbrella `packages/blocks` exactly like an existing BB (add dependency + a catalog/README row + re-export from its `index.ts` **and** `index.cdk.ts`)
- add to the root `workspaces`
- add an instance + test to `test-apps/comprehensive` (zero casts)
- `npx changeset add`.

## Quick Start by Task

### Implementing a New Building Block
**→ Start here:** Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full checklist, then:
1. Read `docs/design/API-DESIGN.md` for API guidelines (G1–G18)
2. Study an existing BB (e.g., `packages/bb-kv-store/`) for the file pattern
3. Read `docs/reference/building-block-structure.md` for conventions
4. Follow the **"Authoring a NEW Building Block"** section above

### Fixing a Bug
**Always repro before you fix.** Write a failing test that demonstrates the bug — this is your red. Then make it green. Never fix a bug without a test that would have caught it.

**Prefer e2e over unit for repros.** An e2e test in `test-apps/comprehensive/test/` exercises the same path a customer would hit. Use unit tests only for purely internal logic.

1. `npm install` at root
2. `npm run build`
3. **Write a failing test first** — reproduce the bug in `test-apps/comprehensive/test/` (preferred) or `packages/<affected>/src/*.test.ts` (if purely internal). Confirm it fails.
4. Fix the code in `packages/bb-*/`
5. Confirm your test now passes: `npm run test:e2e:local` (e2e) or `cd packages/<affected> && npm test` (unit)
6. Run full integration tests: `npm run test:e2e:local` from root
7. Verify no regressions in related packages

### Understanding Architecture
1. `docs/reference/ARCHITECTURE-LAYERS.md` — the four-export layer model
2. `docs/reference/building-block-structure.md` — file conventions
3. Root `README.md` — how conditional exports work

### Discovering Building Block Documentation
When working in an AWS Blocks application (not this monorepo), Building Block documentation lives in `node_modules`. Start from `node_modules/@aws-blocks/blocks/README.md` — it lists all Building Blocks with their package names and has instructions for locating each package's full README.

---

## Conventions

| Area | Rule |
|---|---|
| Linter/formatter | **Biome** (not ESLint/Prettier): tabs (width 4), 120 cols, single quotes, trailing commas everywhere, semicolons always. `biome check` = lint + format + import-sort. |
| Modules | **ESM everywhere**; relative imports carry the `.js` extension. `strict: true`, ES2022, `moduleResolution: bundler`. |
| Naming | BB class `PascalCase`, no "BB" prefix (`KVStore`). pkg `@aws-blocks/bb-{kebab}`. errors `{Class}Errors`. The **`BLOCKS_` env prefix is framework-reserved** — not for example app code. Auth BBs lead with `Auth` (`AuthBasic`, `AuthOIDC`, `AuthCognito`). |
| Schema validation | When a BB accepts a user-provided validation schema, type it as **`StandardSchemaV1`** (Zod/Valibot/ArkType) — don't pull a schema lib into the BB's runtime deps (it's the consumer's choice); if your own tests use `zod`, keep it a `devDependency`. (A BB may take a schema lib as a real `dependency` only for its *own* internal needs, e.g. `bb-agent`.) Validate via `schema['~standard'].validate(value)`, before conditional checks. |
| Tests | **`node:test` + `node:assert`** (not Jest/Vitest), run on compiled `dist/`. Reset `.bb-data` between tests. Mock tests can't catch AWS-path serialization bugs — serialization/behavior changes also need a sandbox e2e. |
| Async | `async/await` only; prefer **`Array.fromAsync()`** over `for await` push-loops. |

---

## ⚠️ E2E Tests Are Customer DX — No Type Casts

The e2e tests in `test-apps/comprehensive/` represent exactly what a customer would write. They exist to validate the end-to-end type-safe DX, so **never use `as any`, `: any`, or other type casts** in test code that represents customer usage.

**What represents customer code:** API calls, their return values, callback parameters, and any chaining or destructuring of results. If a customer would write it, the test should compile without casts.

**What doesn't:** Test infrastructure like fetch spies, cookie jars, server lifecycle, and deploy scripts. Casts in plumbing code are fine.

If a test won't compile without a cast, the Building Block's public types are wrong — fix the types at the source, not in the test.

---

## ⚠️ Docstrings Are Sacred

**Never remove, truncate, or rewrite existing JSDoc/docstrings** on exported functions, types, classes, or interfaces. These are the primary documentation surface for customers and agents working in IDEs — they show on hover and in autocomplete.

When modifying a function:
- **Preserve** all existing docstring content (usage examples, parameter descriptions, best practices, scaling notes)
- **Add** to docstrings if the behavior changes
- **Update** references if names change
- **Never** strip a docstring down to a one-liner summary

If you must rewrite a file from scratch, diff the docstrings against the previous version before committing.

---

## ⚠️ Running Long-Lived Processes (dev server, sandbox)

**Never run `npm run dev`, `npm run sandbox`, or any blocking server directly in a shell command.**
These processes don't exit — they will hang the agent indefinitely.

### Required pattern: tmux + polling

```bash
# 1. Start in a background tmux session
tmux new-session -d -s dev 'cd test-apps/comprehensive && npm run dev'

# 2. Poll every few seconds until ready
for i in $(seq 1 30); do
  sleep 3
  OUTPUT=$(tmux capture-pane -t dev -p)
  echo "$OUTPUT" | grep -q "local server running" && echo "READY" && break
  echo "... waiting ($i)"
done

# 3. Do your work (run tests, curl endpoints, etc.)

# 4. Kill the session when done
tmux kill-session -t dev
```

### Sandbox lifecycle

Sandbox deploys take 2–3 minutes (CDK CloudFormation). Use the same tmux + polling pattern.

**If you deployed a sandbox and are done with it, always run `npm run destroy` (from the test app directory) before finishing.**
Leaving sandboxes running wastes AWS resources.

---

## Local dev, deploy & stages

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run build` · `npm test` (`test:unit`) | TS project-reference build · unit tests on `dist/` |
| `npm run build:force` | Clean + rebuild (use after refactors) |
| `npm run test:e2e:local` / `test:e2e:sandbox` | e2e against the dev server / a real AWS sandbox |
| `npm run lint` / `lint:deps` | Biome / undeclared-dependency check (blocking) |
| `npm run check:api` | API Extractor reports |
| `npm run update:api` | Regenerate API reports (after intentional API changes) |
| `npx changeset add` | required for any published-package change |

- Node **22** (`.nvmrc`). Mock data → `.bb-data/{fullId}/`.
- Stages: a transient **sandbox** vs **production**. Spin a sandbox via the scripts in `@aws-blocks/blocks/scripts` (`startSandbox`/`startDevServer`); run `test:e2e:sandbox` to validate the real AWS path; tear it down (`npm run destroy`) when done.

---

## ✅ Before you open a PR

- [ ] `npm run build && npm run lint:deps && npm test && npm run test:e2e:local` pass locally
- [ ] Changeset added (covers every changed published package), changelog-appropriate wording
- [ ] README / DESIGN / JSDoc updated **in this PR**; snippets, commands, links verified at HEAD
- [ ] Conditional-export parity holds; new runtime methods have `synthGuard` stubs
- [ ] New behavior or security change ships a test (sandbox e2e if serialization changed)
- [ ] Breaking change? → flag for maintainer review (see "How to work here"); prefer a backward-compatible fallback

CI runs build, lint, the undeclared-dependency check, unit + e2e tests, and a changeset check.

---

## API design principles (beyond the Core rules)

- **Options objects, not positional params** — adding an options field is non-breaking; a positional argument is not. Avoid overloads (vary behavior with options).
- **Method names signal cost** — `get`/`put`/`delete`; expose `*Batch` only when the service has a native batch API; `query` is indexed, `scan` is full-table.
- Use `AsyncIterable` for **unbounded result sets**; be **async by default** for anything touching storage/network.
- **Return client-safe values** — plain JSON-serializable data, or a Transferable for live client objects (`bb-realtime`); never return a `Scope` subclass from an `ApiNamespace` method.
- **Don't leak AWS primitives** (ARNs, SDK types, service IDs) in public signatures — the CDK entry may use CDK types.
- `fromExisting()` returns a **reference object** (a constructor input), not a constructed BB.
- **The constructor is the only side effect** — register/provision there; methods are pure runtime ops.
- **Document every public method** (one-liner, params, returns, throwable errors, an example); keep README and JSDoc in sync.

For the full set of guidelines (G1–G18) with rationale, examples, and the BB design document template, see [`docs/design/API-DESIGN.md`](docs/design/API-DESIGN.md).

## Reviewing a PR
Check correctness/security, mock↔aws↔cdk↔browser consistency + conditional-export parity, doc accuracy (verify snippets/links at HEAD), and test coverage. Label **Blocking** / **Suggestion** / **Nit**, cite a location with a concrete fix, and reserve change-requests for substance (correctness, security, broken backward-compat, behavior change without a test) — not style.

## Where to look
- `packages/bb-kv-store/` — reference for the typical file layout & layering (its *data model* is KV-specific).
- `packages/bb-realtime/` — reference for the full client↔server surface + the Transferable client-hydration pattern.
- Each BB's `README.md` — the authoritative API doc for that block.
- `docs/` — architecture and design background
- `packages/hosting/README.md` — SPA/SSR frontend hosting
- `bb-data` / `bb-distributed-data` READMEs — DB migrations
- `native/*` — Kotlin/Swift/Dart client codegen
- per-template `AGENTS.md` (via `npm create @aws-blocks/blocks-app@latest my-app`) — building an app *with* AWS Blocks.
