# Logger — Design

Design document for Logger. For usage, see [README.md](./README.md).

**Package:** `@aws-blocks/bb-logger`
**Type:** Composite (optional infrastructure)
**AWS Service:** Amazon CloudWatch Logs (via Lambda's built-in log integration)

## Infrastructure (CDK)

**Logging is always on and Logger owns no deploy-time infrastructure.** Every
compute captures stdout to a single CloudWatch Logs LogGroup for its handler,
created by the compute itself. There is no "enable logging" seam — logs always
exist for every compute.

Because logging is unconditional, the CDK `Logger` is a **no-op placeholder**:
its constructor just lets `new Logger(scope, id)` resolve in a CDK app. Any
number of Loggers can coexist freely (they own nothing to collide over). The
two things a Logger *used* to carry now live elsewhere:

- **Retention** is a **compute-level setting**, not a Logger option. A compute's
  handler log group takes its retention from that compute's `logRetention` prop
  (e.g. `LambdaCompute`'s `logRetention`), falling back to the stack-wide
  `defaults.logRetention`. Set retention where the compute is constructed, not
  on a Logger. (The `retention` option was removed from `LoggingOptions`.)
- **Log level** is purely per-instance *runtime* behavior. A `Logger`'s `level`
  is applied by the logger instance itself; a logger without an explicit `level`
  defaults to `'info'` (see *Log Level Resolution* below). Blocks does **not**
  stamp an app-wide default — there is no `defaults.logLevel`, no `LOG_LEVEL`
  env var, and the CDK layer provisions nothing for level. This is why multiple
  Loggers with different levels coexist without fighting over shared config.

## Serialization Format

Each log entry is a single-line JSON object written to stdout (debug/info/warn) or stderr (error):

```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "message": "Request handled",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T12:00:00.000Z",
  "logger": "app",
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/users"
}
```

Fields:
- `level` — Log severity (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`).
- `message` — The log message string.
- `timestamp` — ISO 8601 timestamp from `new Date().toISOString()`.
- `logger` — The `id` passed to the constructor.
- `traceId` — X-Ray trace ID (auto-injected from `_X_AMZN_TRACE_ID` env var when present).
- Spread fields from `defaultContext`, `child()` context, and per-call `context` (later wins).

### Serialization Safety

- **Circular references** → replaced with `"[Circular]"` via WeakSet tracking.
- **BigInt values** → converted to string representation.
- **Functions/Symbols** → replaced with `"[unserializable]"`.
- **Error objects in context** → extracted to `{ name, message, stack }`.
- **Serialization failure** → emits a degraded entry with `_serializationError: 'SerializationFailedException'`.

## Interface Decisions

### Synchronous Methods

All logging methods are **synchronous**. This is an intentional deviation from the "Async by Default" guideline. Logging writes to stdout/stderr which Lambda captures asynchronously. Returning a Promise would add overhead for zero benefit — logging should never block.

### Child Loggers

`child()` returns a `ChildLogger` interface (not a full `Logger` Scope node). Children:
- Inherit the parent's log level and default context.
- Merge additional context on top (later wins on key conflicts).
- Can be nested arbitrarily (`child().child().child()`).
- Are lightweight objects — no Scope registration, no CDK constructs.

### Log Level Resolution

Priority order (highest wins):
1. Constructor `options.level`
2. Default: `'info'`

## Mock Implementation

The mock entry point (`index.mock.ts`) re-exports the AWS runtime (`index.aws.ts`) directly. Both environments use the same code: write structured JSON to `process.stdout` / `process.stderr`. There is no mock-specific behavior because the logging mechanism (stdout/stderr → CloudWatch) is provided by the Lambda runtime, not by the BB.

- No files created in `.bb-data/` — logs are ephemeral.
- Retention is a cloud-only concept (no local CloudWatch equivalent); it is a
  compute-level setting and has no effect locally.
- Log level filtering works identically to production.

### Mock vs AWS Behavior Differences

| Behavior Difference | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|--------|------------|
| No CloudWatch Logs Insights | Cannot test Insights queries locally | Sandbox testing for Insights queries |
| No log retention enforcement | Logs are ephemeral in local terminal | No mitigation needed — local logs don't persist |
| No log group/stream structure | Cannot test subscription filters | Sandbox testing covers these |
| No X-Ray trace ID injection | `traceId` field absent locally | Set `_X_AMZN_TRACE_ID` env var manually if needed |
