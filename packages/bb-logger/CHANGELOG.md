## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d7312f9: Make observability **compute-driven** so it composes correctly once an app has more than one compute. Logging, tracing, and the dashboard now key off compute state rather than off the Logger / Tracer / Dashboard blocks poking a single implicit compute.
  
  **Logging is always on; retention is a compute-level setting.** Every compute captures stdout to its own log group unconditionally — there is no "enable logging" step. The retention of that group is set per compute via a new `logRetention` prop on `LambdaCompute` (`@aws-blocks/bb-lambda-compute`), falling back to `defaults.logRetention`. Log **level** is purely per-instance runtime behavior: set it via a `Logger`'s `level` option (default `'info'`). There is no app-wide log-level default and no `LOG_LEVEL` env var.
  
  **Tracing is presence-gated.** Creating any `Tracer` in the app now enables X-Ray on **every** compute (X-Ray provisions real, costed infrastructure, so it stays off until the app opts in by constructing a Tracer). This replaces the previous model where a Tracer turned on tracing for one implicit compute. `@aws-blocks/core/cdk` adds `registerTracer()` (records Tracer presence) and `finalizeTracing()` (enables tracing on all computes at finalize); `create()` runs it before finalizing dashboards. `Compute.enableTracing()` is now idempotent.
  
  **The dashboard is organized by compute, with display toggles.** `DashboardOptions` gains `logs?: boolean` (default `true`) and `traces?: boolean` (default `true`) — app-wide display toggles applied uniformly to every compute section. `logs:false` hides the (always-captured) logs section; `traces:false` hides traces even when tracing is enabled.
  
  The dashboard covers **every** compute in the app (resolved at finalize, so construction order never matters). Each compute renders a health section always, a logs section (unless `logs:false`), and a traces section only when tracing is enabled on it (unless `traces:false`). Metrics remain app-scoped and are passed explicitly. No `computes` selector is exposed yet — it would leak the internal `Compute` type before customers can construct a compute; it arrives with the multi-compute surface.
  
  **⚠️ Behavior / API changes:**
  
  - **`Logger` no longer reconfigures log retention.** The CDK `Logger` is now a no-op placeholder (logging is always on and retention moved to the compute). The `retention` option was removed from `LoggingOptions`; set `logRetention` on the compute instead.
  - **A `Tracer` now enables X-Ray on all computes, not one.** Any Tracer in the app turns on tracing fleet-wide.
  - **`Logger` no longer reads the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.** Log level is set solely via the per-`Logger` `level` option (default `'info'`); the previously supported `LOG_LEVEL` env-var override has been removed, and Blocks stamps no app-wide log-level config. `BlocksDefaults` has no `logLevel` field.
  - **Removed the deprecated `LoggerBBRef` / `TracerBBRef` dashboard types.** They were no longer consumed — the dashboard reads compute state directly. Loggers and Tracers were never passed to the Dashboard in this model.

### Patch Changes

- 5eee114: Add npm keywords for discoverability via `npm search keywords:aws-blocks`
  
  Every published package now carries an npm `keywords` array: the shared `aws-blocks`
  discovery tag plus 2–5 functional keywords describing the package's domain and the
  AWS services it uses (e.g. `realtime`, `websocket`, `pubsub` for `bb-realtime`;
  `ci-cd`, `pipelines`, `deployment` for `pipeline`). Metadata only — no runtime,
  API, or behavior change.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- c45eb92: Extend stack-wide `BlocksDefaults` (introduced in the Infrastructure Options work) with three additive fields, and adopt them across the Blocks-managed infrastructure. Each field is read independently via `option ?? scope.defaults.field` — a per-block option always wins, and no field is derived from another.
  
  `@aws-blocks/core/cdk` now adds to `BlocksDefaults` (and both `BlocksPresets`):
  
  - `logRetention: RetentionDays` — how long Blocks-managed CloudWatch log groups keep events. Preset sandbox `ONE_WEEK`, production `ONE_YEAR`.
  - `throttling: { rateLimit, burstLimit }` — request-rate limits applied to every Blocks API Gateway stage. Preset sandbox `200 / 400`, production `1000 / 2000`.
  - `accessLogging: boolean` — structured JSON access logs on every Blocks API Gateway stage. **Off by default in both presets** (opt-in), because enabling it mutates the account/region-level API Gateway CloudWatch role singleton.
  
  Also newly exported from `@aws-blocks/core/cdk`: the `BlocksThrottling` type and `ensureApiGatewayAccount()` (provisions the account-level API Gateway CloudWatch Logs role once per stack). `Scope` gains a `handlerLogGroup` getter for the shared handler log group.
  
  **Log retention** — Blocks-managed log groups now follow `defaults.logRetention` instead of AWS's infinite default: the shared handler Lambda (now owned by `BlocksStack`/`BlocksBackend` as `scope.handlerLogGroup`), the `bb-distributed-table` GSI-manager Lambdas, the `bb-distributed-data` DSQL migration Lambda, the `bb-data` Aurora migration Lambda, and the `bb-app-setting` secret-init Lambda. `bb-logger` reconfigures the shared handler group's retention — **only when an explicit per-Logger `retention` is set** (a bare `Logger` no longer writes it back, so it can't clobber another Logger's value) — rather than creating its own `/aws/lambda/<fn>` group. (Note: the framework `custom-resources.Provider` Lambdas these BBs wrap still use AWS's default retention — the L2 `Provider` exposes no log-group/retention override.)
  
  **Throttling** — applied to the core REST API stage and the `bb-realtime` WebSocket stage. On a WebSocket stage the throttle unit is messages/second across the connection.
  
  **Access logging** — when enabled, each stage writes structured JSON access logs to a dedicated CloudWatch log group (retention = `defaults.logRetention`, removal policy = `defaults.removalPolicy` so production **RETAIN**s the audit trail on teardown). The account-level API Gateway CloudWatch Logs role is provisioned once per stack and shared across stages.
  
  **⚠️ Behavior changes on upgrade:**
  - **Throttling now caps the core REST API and WebSocket stages.** Before this change these stages had no stage-level throttle (they ran at the API Gateway account default, ~10k rps). After upgrade, sandbox is capped at 200 rps / 400 burst and production at 1000 rps / 2000 burst. Apps serving above the production ceiling will see `429`s — raise it with a per-stack `throttling` override (`defaults: { ...BlocksPresets.production, throttling: { rateLimit, burstLimit } }`).
  - **The shared handler Lambda log group changes.** The handler previously logged to Lambda's auto-created `/aws/lambda/<fn>` group (infinite retention); it now logs to a framework-owned group with the default retention. On upgrade the old auto group is left orphaned in CloudWatch (unmanaged, still infinite) — delete it manually if you want its history/cost gone. Likewise a `bb-logger`-created retention group from a prior version is replaced.
  - **Access logging** is **opt-in (off in both presets)**. When enabled it requires the account-level API Gateway CloudWatch Logs role — an account/region-level singleton, so enabling it is safe for **one Blocks stack per region** (see `ensureApiGatewayAccount()` for the multi-stack teardown caveat). It defaults off (rather than on for production) so an upgrade never mutates that account-wide singleton without an explicit opt-in.
  - **`BlocksDefaults` gains three required fields** (`logRetention`, `throttling`, `accessLogging`). Apps that spread a `BlocksPresets` preset (the documented path) are unaffected; code that hand-rolls a literal `BlocksDefaults` object will need to add the new fields to compile.
  
  `bb-dashboard` now points its log widgets at the framework-owned handler log
  group (`scope.handlerLogGroup.logGroupName`) instead of reconstructing
  `/aws/lambda/<fn>` — the handler now writes to a dedicated group with a
  CDK-generated name, so the old convention would leave the "Recent Errors" /
  "Log Volume" widgets querying an empty group.
  
  Hosting adoption of these defaults (SSR REST API + compute log groups) ships in a separate change.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 3c56267: `AuthBasic` and `Logger` now report `bbName`/`bbVersion` to `Scope`, so they appear in telemetry like every other Building Block.

  Both were listed in the umbrella's `aws-blocks.vendorize` map, so `scripts/generate-bb-names.mjs` had already generated them into `OFFICIAL_BB_NAMES` — but neither passed `bbMeta` to `super()`, and `Scope` only records a block in its registry when `bbName` is set. Their entries in that set were therefore inert: `Scope.getRegisteredBlocks()` could never name either block, so `product.buildingBlocks` under-reported two of the most widely used blocks. Each package now carries the standard `prebuild` (`generate-version.mjs AuthBasic` / `Logger`), which generates the `BB_NAME`/`BB_VERSION` its constructor passes through — the same wiring the other blocks use.

  `Logger` is composed internally by most other blocks (`new Logger(this, 'logger', { level: 'error' })`), so it will now be reported for effectively every application, and `totalCount` rises accordingly. That is the intended reading of the existing `Logger` entry in the vendorize map, not a new disclosure: `getRegisteredBlocks()` still exposes only names already on the official list, and customer-chosen block names remain counted-but-unnamed.

  `@aws-blocks/blocks` takes a `patch` because it re-exports both blocks; sibling releases stay inside its caret range, so `changeset version` would not bump it on its own (#273, #212). `@aws-blocks/core` needs no bump — both names were already present in the generated `OFFICIAL_BB_NAMES`, so that file is byte-identical.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- ba3bf7b: docs: add per-package DESIGN.md documents

  Adds a `DESIGN.md` to each building-block package describing its architecture, API surface, mock implementation, and key design decisions.

  - Each document is cross-checked against the current source so identifiers, environment variables, error names, and described behavior match the implementation.
  - Each `DESIGN.md` is listed in its package's `files` array so it ships on npm alongside `README.md`.
  - For consistency, `bb-auth-cognito`'s document lives at the package root like every other package.
  - Bumps the umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` package so its bundled `docs/` — assembled from these block READMEs at build time — republishes with a fresh version. Its packed content changes whenever the READMEs change, but the version was previously left untouched, which tripped the publish integrity guard.
