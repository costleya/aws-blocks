/**
 * Local-dev (mock) and types entry point for `LambdaCompute`.
 *
 * Local dev runs the backend in-process with no Lambda, so — as at runtime —
 * there is nothing for a compute to provision or execute. The mock reuses the
 * inert runtime handle: it constructs and its `setEnv` is a no-op. This entry
 * also backs the package's public `types`, so the customer-facing type is the
 * CDK-free `Compute` handle.
