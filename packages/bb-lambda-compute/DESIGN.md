# LambdaCompute — Design

Design document for `@aws-blocks/bb-lambda-compute`. For usage, see [README.md](./README.md).

**Package:** `@aws-blocks/bb-lambda-compute`
**Type:** Compute (framework infrastructure, not a customer-facing data block)
**AWS Services:** Lambda (`NodejsFunction`) + API Gateway (REST)

## Why a compute is a Building Block

A Blocks app runs its handler code on a *compute*. Modeling compute as a
first-class type — rather than inlining a Lambda and API Gateway in core — lets
one app run on multiple compute targets (Lambda, containers, customer-owned) and
target namespaces and handlers at specific ones.

`Compute` (the abstract base) lives in `@aws-blocks/core` because it is a
framework primitive: `Scope`, the base every block extends, resolves the compute
a handler runs on, so the type it resolves to must be visible to core. The
concrete `LambdaCompute` lives in its own package so core never depends on a
concrete compute implementation — the same package-boundary split the framework
uses for client middleware, where core defines the seam and a block package
supplies the implementation.

## Infrastructure (CDK)

`LambdaCompute extends Compute` and, in its constructor, provisions and owns:

- **A `NodejsFunction`** — 2048 MB memory, 15-minute timeout, `NODE_ENV=production`,
  bundled with `--conditions=aws-runtime` so blocks resolve their runtime (not
  CDK/mock) entry points. It assumes the **shared Blocks execution role**
  (`this.executionRole`) rather than an auto-generated per-function role, so
  Building Block grants — which target that shared role — reach it.
- **A CloudWatch log group** for the function (`logGroup`), passed as the
  function's `logGroup` so its retention follows the stack-wide
  `defaults.logRetention` instead of AWS's infinite default. It is a single
  framework-owned group (not a second `/aws/lambda/<fn>` group), so `bb-logger`
  reconfigures it and `bb-dashboard` reads its name via `scope.handlerLogGroup`.
  Named `logGroup` (not `handlerLogGroup`) to avoid clashing with the inherited
  `Scope.handlerLogGroup` accessor. `RemovalPolicy.DESTROY` — the handler's
  operational stdout is not durable state.
- **An API Gateway REST API** fronting the function:
  - the `/aws-blocks` resource gets a proxy so `RawRoute` sub-paths reach the
    function;
  - `/aws-blocks/api` gets explicit `POST` + `OPTIONS` methods (the JSON-RPC
    endpoint);
  - the root gets a catch-all proxy so all other paths reach the function.
  - **Throttling** — the stage's method throttle comes from `defaults.throttling`
    (sandbox 200/400, production 1000/2000).
  - **Access logging** — when `defaults.accessLogging` is true (opt-in; off in
    both presets), the stage writes structured JSON access logs to a dedicated
    CloudWatch log group (retention = `defaults.logRetention`, removal policy =
    `defaults.removalPolicy` — production RETAINs the audit trail on teardown,
    sandbox DESTROYs). `cloudWatchRole` is disabled on the `RestApi` so it does
    not mint its own `AWS::ApiGateway::Account`; instead the shared account-level
    CloudWatch Logs role is provisioned once per stack via
    `ensureApiGatewayAccount()`, and the stage depends on it so a clean-account
    first deploy applies the account setting before the stage is created.
    Note: a production (RETAINed) access-log group is **orphaned** on stack
    teardown and is the operator's to clean up. The group is intentionally left
    unnamed (CDK-generated physical name) so a teardown-then-redeploy mints a
    fresh name and can't collide — do not pin a stable `logGroupName`, or a
    RETAINed group from a prior delete would fail the next create.

Public surface (CDK layer):

| Member | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `fn` | `NodejsFunction` | The function backing this compute. |
| `apiGateway` | `RestApi` | The REST API fronting `fn`. |
| `logGroup` | `LogGroup` | The function's CloudWatch log group (retention from `defaults.logRetention`). |
| `setEnv(key, value)` | `void` | Inject a runtime env var onto the function — the `Compute` contract the framework calls instead of `handler.addEnvironment` directly. |

### Identity-scoped request dispatch

`LambdaComputeProps.identityPool` optionally associates a structural Identity
Pool reference with this individual compute. The reference needs only the
provider's `fullId`; the CDK layer binds that identifier through core and does
not import or depend on the concrete Identity Pool Building Block. Core uses the
association when it dispatches namespaces and raw routes to the compute. A
request with a valid authenticated provider identity runs inside the provider
callback before application code executes. When the provider supports guests, a
request with no supplied login runs in its guest identity scope. An invalid
supplied login is rejected rather than falling back to guest credentials.
Leaving the option unset preserves the existing Lambda execution-role path.

The runtime and mock handles retain the selected provider `fullId` as metadata
so declarations made from the shared backend module have the same identity
association in every conditional-export layer. They still provision no
infrastructure.

`fn` and `apiGateway` exist only on the CDK layer (they are `aws-cdk-lib`
constructs); `setEnv` is part of the `Compute` contract present in every layer
(a no-op in the non-CDK layers — see below).

## Owner-derived identity

`LambdaCompute` does not take the backend entry path or stack name as a
constructor argument. Both are resolved from the owning `BlocksStack` /
`BlocksBackend` through the `Compute` (→ `Scope`) accessors:

- `backendHandlerPath` → the function's `entry`;
- `backendStackName` → the function's `BLOCKS_STACK_NAME` env var.

`BLOCKS_STACK_NAME` is the token-free identity the runtime rebuilds `fullId`
from, so the physical resource names a block computes at synth match the names
the runtime looks up. Deriving both values from the single owner — never from
the caller — guarantees every compute in an app runs the same backend and
resolves the same resource-name namespace. If they could be passed per compute,
two computes in one app could disagree on either, so owner-derivation removes
that failure mode by construction.

## Conditional-export layers

A Blocks app's backend module is imported in **two phases**: at CDK synth, and
again at request time inside the deployed runtime (the framework ships one
bundle and selects behavior by config, not by shipping different code). A
`new LambdaCompute(...)` line in that module therefore executes in both phases,
so the package resolves a different implementation per phase through conditional
exports:

| Condition | Entry | Role |
|-----------|-------|------|
| `cdk` | `index.cdk.ts` | Provisions the `NodejsFunction` + API Gateway (above). The only layer that touches `aws-cdk-lib`. |
| `aws-runtime` | `index.aws.ts` | An **inert handle**. At runtime the infrastructure already exists and the handler already runs on it, so the compute provisions nothing; it constructs (so the import succeeds and `{ compute }` references resolve) and `setEnv` is a no-op — config is injected at synth. |
| `default` / `types` | `index.mock.ts` | Local dev runs the backend in-process with no Lambda, so it reuses the same inert handle. Also backs the public `types`, so the customer-facing type is the CDK-free `Compute` handle. |
| `browser` | `index.browser.ts` | A stub. The backend module is type-imported by frontends; this keeps `aws-cdk-lib` out of the browser bundle. |

The runtime, mock, and browser layers extend the runtime `Scope` (not the CDK
one), so **only the `cdk` layer ever pulls in `aws-cdk-lib`** — the deployed
function and the browser bundle stay free of CDK. This is the same layering data
blocks use; a compute differs only in that its non-CDK layers carry no
request-time behavior (nothing to persist or serve), so they are inert rather
than SDK-backed.

It is excluded from the customer-facing Building Block catalog
(`scripts/sync-catalog.mjs` + `scripts/gen-block-docs.mjs`) and the vendorize map
(`packages/blocks`): an app author does not select a compute the way they select
`KVStore` or `Database`. It is framework machinery.

## Fit within the multi-compute model

`LambdaCompute` is the Lambda implementation of the compute abstraction and the
framework's default compute. It slots into the broader model as follows:

- **Default compute.** `LambdaCompute` is the framework's default compute,
  injected so core can build it without importing the concrete class — see
  [How the default compute is injected](#how-the-default-compute-is-injected).
- **Compute resolution.** `Scope.compute` resolves the compute a handler runs
  on: an explicit assignment on the block or an ancestor scope, else the app's
  default compute.
- **Resource ownership.** The default compute owns the Lambda function and API
  Gateway that back a stack's `handler` / `gateway` / `apiUrl`; those stack
  accessors delegate to it.
- **Other compute types.** Sibling packages provide container and
  customer-owned `Compute` implementations; event blocks that need
  compute-specific delivery narrow on the concrete type.

The broader multi-compute model also covers request routing across computes,
per-compute event delivery, the IAM and trust model, and VPC networking — none
of which live in this package.

## How the default compute is injected

Core must obtain a `LambdaCompute` **without importing it**. The dependency
arrow only points one way — `@aws-blocks/bb-lambda-compute` depends on
`@aws-blocks/core`, never the reverse — because the reverse would be a cycle and
would drag the concrete CDK class (and `aws-cdk-lib`) into core. So core defines
the seam (a factory *type* and a required props field), and the umbrella
`@aws-blocks/blocks` — the one package that depends on both core and this one —
supplies a concrete factory through a normal `import`.

### The three participants

- **Core owns the seam** (`packages/core/src/cdk/compute/default-compute-factory.ts`,
  exposed via `@aws-blocks/core/cdk/internal`): just the factory *type*.

  ```ts
  export type DefaultComputeFactory = (root: BlocksStack | BlocksBackend) => Compute;
  ```

  `create()` reads the factory from its **props** — core defines
  `CoreBlocksStackProps` / `CoreBlocksBackendProps` (the public
  `BlocksStackProps` / `BlocksBackendProps` plus a required
  `defaultComputeFactory`) — and calls it to build the default:

  ```ts
  export interface CoreBlocksStackProps extends BlocksStackProps {
    defaultComputeFactory: DefaultComputeFactory;
  }

  static async create(scope, id, props: CoreBlocksStackProps) {
    ...
    stack._defaultCompute = props.defaultComputeFactory(stack);   // before the backend import
  }
  ```

  The factory rides on the props but **not the customer-facing type** — it lives
  on `CoreBlocksStackProps`, absent from the public `BlocksStackProps`, so a
  bare-`@aws-blocks/core` caller who omits it gets a compile error, not a runtime
  one. Because it is required, core needs no runtime "no factory" guard.

- **The umbrella supplies the factory** (`@aws-blocks/blocks`, `index.cdk.ts`) —
  a plain import of the concrete class, and a thin wrapper around `create()` that
  injects it:

  ```ts
  import { BlocksStack as CoreBlocksStack } from '@aws-blocks/core/cdk';
  import { LambdaCompute } from '@aws-blocks/bb-lambda-compute';

  const lambdaDefaultComputeFactory = (root) => new LambdaCompute(root, 'DefaultCompute');

  export const BlocksStack = {
    create: (scope, id, props) =>
      CoreBlocksStack.create(scope, id, { ...props, defaultComputeFactory: lambdaDefaultComputeFactory }),
  };
  export type BlocksStack = CoreBlocksStack;   // instance type unchanged
  ```

  The umbrella's wrapper accepts only the public `(scope, id, props)`, so a
  customer can't set the factory through it.

  The `import` is a real, visible edge (`@aws-blocks/blocks` → this package) that
  the module graph, bundler, and `lint:deps` all see — not a load-bearing
  side-effect import.

- **The customer calls the umbrella's wrapper.** Every app already does
  `import { BlocksStack } from '@aws-blocks/blocks/cdk'`, so the call site is
  unchanged (`BlocksStack.create(app, id, { backendHandlerPath, backendCDKPath })`);
  the factory is injected for them.

### Execution order (CDK synth)

1. The app calls the umbrella's `BlocksStack.create(...)` / `BlocksBackend.create(...)`.
2. The wrapper forwards to core's `create()`, spreading the factory onto the
   props (public `BlocksStackProps` → `CoreBlocksStackProps`).
3. Inside core's `create()`, `this._defaultCompute = props.defaultComputeFactory(this)`
   runs **before** importing the backend module — so a block that reads
   `this.compute` in its constructor (during that import) resolves to it. That
   call runs `new LambdaCompute(root, 'DefaultCompute')`, provisioning the
   function + API Gateway.
4. `Scope.compute` and the delegating `handler` / `gateway` / `apiUrl` accessors
   read from `_defaultCompute`.

A bare-`@aws-blocks/core` caller must supply `defaultComputeFactory` on the props
(it is required); any app using `@aws-blocks/blocks` gets it injected for free.

The `DefaultComputeFactory` type stays on `@aws-blocks/core/cdk/internal`; none
of this is public, customer-facing surface.
