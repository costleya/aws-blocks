### Minor Changes

- 21443ba: fix(data): map optimistic-concurrency conflicts to JSON-RPC 409 (Conflict) instead of 500
  
  Optimistic-concurrency / conditional-write conflicts now surface to clients as
  JSON-RPC error **code 409 (Conflict)** instead of a generic **500**. Previously
  these conflicts were thrown as plain named `Error`s (or re-thrown raw driver
  errors), and the JSON-RPC serializer maps any non-`ApiError` to 500 — so a
  routine, expected conflict was indistinguishable from an internal server error.
  
  Each affected conflict is now an `ApiError` with `status: 409`, so on the client
  `error.status === 409`. The structured `error.name` is preserved end-to-end, so
  `isBlocksError(e, ...)` keeps matching by name on both server and client, and the
  existing typed error constants are unchanged:
  
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-kv-store` — a failed `ifNotExists` / `ifExists` /
    `ifValueEquals` write or delete (`KVStoreErrors.ConditionalCheckFailed`). The
    AWS runtime now also normalizes DynamoDB's raw `ConditionalCheckFailedException`
    on both `put` and `delete`, matching the mock.
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-distributed-table` — a failed `ifNotExists` / `ifExists` /
    `ifFieldEquals` condition (`DistributedTableErrors.ConditionalCheckFailed`),
    in both mock and AWS `put`/`delete`.
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-distributed-data` — a DSQL serialization failure / OCC
    conflict, SQLSTATE `40001` (`DistributedDatabaseErrors.SerializationFailure`),
    in both the mock and real engines.
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-data` — a serializable-isolation conflict, SQLSTATE `40001`
    (`DatabaseErrors.SerializationFailure`), across the PGlite, pg-client, and
    Data API engines.
  
  The `retriable` flag is scoped to genuine optimistic-lock conflicts: it is
  `true` for value/field-equals conflicts (`ifValueEquals` / `ifFieldEquals`) and
  the 40001 serialization failures, and omitted/`false` for existence/uniqueness
  assertions (`ifNotExists`, `ifExists`), where a blind identical retry would fail
  identically. Status (409) and `error.name` are unchanged in every case.
  
  This is a `minor` bump. Every package here is pre-1.0, where `minor` is this
  repo's signal for a change that can alter existing behavior: callers that
  branched on `error.status === 500` for these conflicts (or on the JSON-RPC error
  code) will now see `409`. Code that matches conflicts by name via
  `isBlocksError` — the documented pattern — is unaffected.
  
  `@aws-blocks/core` and `@aws-blocks/blocks` get a `patch` bump for a docs-only
  change: a clarifying sentence was added to the `ApiError.retriable` JSDoc
  (no behavior or API change).

### Patch Changes

- 5eee114: Add npm keywords for discoverability via `npm search keywords:aws-blocks`
  
  Every published package now carries an npm `keywords` array: the shared `aws-blocks`
  discovery tag plus 2–5 functional keywords describing the package's domain and the
  AWS services it uses (e.g. `realtime`, `websocket`, `pubsub` for `bb-realtime`;
  `ci-cd`, `pipelines`, `deployment` for `pipeline`). Metadata only — no runtime,
  API, or behavior change.
- 6496713: Simplify VPC implementation: replace `registerVpcEndpoint` (instanceof-based) with two explicit methods (`registerVpcGatewayEndpoint` / `registerVpcInterfaceEndpoint`), simplify `BlocksVpcOptions` to `{ network, subnets?, provisionEndpoints? }`, and strip persistent test VPC to bare minimum.
- 6496713: feat(core): constructor-forced VPC requirements, lazy VPC, and Database subnet control
  
  Continues the VPC review follow-ups (net-new, unreleased VPC feature).
  
  **Building Blocks declare VPC requirements via the constructor, not a method.**
  `BuildingBlockScope` is no longer abstract: its constructor takes the block's VPC
  requirements (a value, or a callback for values that depend on `fullId`) and
  registers them in a central per-stack registry. This keeps the compile-time
  forcing the previous `abstract getVpcRequirements()` provided — a block can't
  silently omit its requirements — without a standing method on every subclass, and
  gives the framework one place to read, deduplicate, and answer "does anything here
  need a VPC?". All Building Blocks were migrated to pass requirements to `super()`.
  
  **VPC is now a derived resource, not a hard prerequisite.** A block that cannot
  function without a VPC declares `requiresVpc: true`; when one is needed and the
  customer didn't bring their own, Blocks lazily creates a single shared VPC
  (generalizing the create-if-absent behavior `bb-data` already used for Aurora) and
  emits a notice about the NAT cost. Setting `defaults.vpc = { network }` remains the
  bring-your-own override.
  
  **`Database` accepts an optional `subnets` placement.** A CDK-free mirror of
  `ec2.SubnetSelection` (tier as a string, subnets by id) lets you steer where the
  Aurora cluster lands — for a bring-your-own VPC that lacks an isolated tier, or a
  compliance requirement to use specific subnets. Omit it to keep the default
  (prefer isolated, fall back to `private-with-egress`).

### Patch Changes

- c45eb92: Extend stack-wide `BlocksDefaults` (introduced in the Infrastructure Options work) with three additive fields, and adopt them across the Blocks-managed infrastructure. Each field is read independently via `option ?? scope.defaults.field` — a per-block option always wins, and no field is derived from another.
  
  `@aws-blocks/core/cdk` now adds to `BlocksDefaults` (and both `BlocksPresets`):
  
  - `logRetention: RetentionDays` — how long Blocks-managed CloudWatch log groups keep events. Preset sandbox `ONE_WEEK`, production `ONE_YEAR`.
  - `throttling: { rateLimit, burstLimit }` — request-rate limits applied to every Blocks API Gateway stage. Preset sandbox `200 / 400`, production `1000 / 2000`.
  - `accessLogging: boolean` — structured JSON access logs on every Blocks API Gateway stage. **Off by default in both presets** (opt-in), because enabling it mutates the account/region-level API Gateway CloudWatch role singleton.
  
  Also newly exported from `@aws-blocks/core/cdk`: the `BlocksThrottling` type and `ensureApiGatewayAccount()` (provisions the account-level API Gateway CloudWatch Logs role once per stack). `Scope` gains a `handlerLogGroup` getter for the shared handler log group.
  
  **Log retention** — Blocks-managed log groups now follow `defaults.logRetention` instead of AWS's infinite default: the shared handler Lambda (now owned by `BlocksStack`/`BlocksBackend` as `scope.handlerLogGroup`), the `bb-distributed-table` GSI-manager Lambdas, the `bb-distributed-data` DSQL migration Lambda, the `bb-data` Aurora migration Lambda, and the `bb-app-setting` secret-init Lambda. `bb-logger` reconfigures the shared handler group's retention — **only when an explicit per-Logger `retention` is set** (a bare `Logger` no longer writes it back, so it can't clobber another Logger's value) — rather than creating its own `/aws/lambda/<fn>` group. (Note: the framework `custom-resources.Provider` Lambdas these BBs wrap still use AWS's default retention — the L2 `Provider` exposes no log-group/retention override.)
  
  **Throttling** — applied to the core REST API stage and the `bb-realtime` WebSocket stage. On a WebSocket stage the throttle unit is messages/second across the connection.
  
  **Access logging** — when enabled, each stage writes structured JSON access logs to a dedicated CloudWatch log group (retention = `defaults.logRetention`, removal policy = `defaults.removalPolicy` so production **RETAIN**s the audit trail on teardown). The account-level API Gateway CloudWatch Logs role is provisioned once per stack and shared across stages.
  
  **⚠️ Behavior changes on upgrade:**
  - **Throttling now caps the core REST API and WebSocket stages.** Before this change these stages had no stage-level throttle (they ran at the API Gateway account default, ~10k rps). After upgrade, sandbox is capped at 200 rps / 400 burst and production at 1000 rps / 2000 burst. Apps serving above the production ceiling will see `429`s — raise it with a per-stack `throttling` override (`defaults: { ...BlocksPresets.production, throttling: { rateLimit, burstLimit } }`).
  - **The shared handler Lambda log group changes.** The handler previously logged to Lambda's auto-created `/aws/lambda/<fn>` group (infinite retention); it now logs to a framework-owned group with the default retention. On upgrade the old auto group is left orphaned in CloudWatch (unmanaged, still infinite) — delete it manually if you want its history/cost gone. Likewise a `bb-logger`-created retention group from a prior version is replaced.
  - **Access logging** is **opt-in (off in both presets)**. When enabled it requires the account-level API Gateway CloudWatch Logs role — an account/region-level singleton, so enabling it is safe for **one Blocks stack per region** (see `ensureApiGatewayAccount()` for the multi-stack teardown caveat). It defaults off (rather than on for production) so an upgrade never mutates that account-wide singleton without an explicit opt-in.
  - **`BlocksDefaults` gains three required fields** (`logRetention`, `throttling`, `accessLogging`). Apps that spread a `BlocksPresets` preset (the documented path) are unaffected; code that hand-rolls a literal `BlocksDefaults` object will need to add the new fields to compile.
  
  `bb-dashboard` now points its log widgets at the framework-owned handler log
  group (`scope.handlerLogGroup.logGroupName`) instead of reconstructing
  `/aws/lambda/<fn>` — the handler now writes to a dedicated group with a
  CDK-generated name, so the old convention would leave the "Recent Errors" /
  "Log Volume" widgets querying an empty group.
  
  Hosting adoption of these defaults (SSR REST API + compute log groups) ships in a separate change.
- 8de4a56: `DistributedTable` mock: order GSI sort-key ties deterministically to match DynamoDB.
  
  When a GSI sort key was shared by multiple items, the mock's `query` fell back to Map insertion order for the tied rows — so results depended on write order / disk-reload order and diverged from deployed behavior. The mock now tie-breaks on the base-table primary key (partition key, then sort key), matching DynamoDB's observed ordering for index rows with equal sort keys, and reverses the whole order (ties included) under `order: 'desc'`. AWS doesn't document a contractual guarantee for the tie order, so the mock is intentionally deterministic even where DynamoDB's contract is unspecified. No change for unique sort keys.

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- 08ab129: `DistributedTable`: make production DynamoDB tables secure by default, and add options to tune it.
  
  Previously every table this block provisioned shipped with Point-in-Time Recovery disabled, deletion protection off, no explicit SSE-KMS, and CDK's default removal policy — so a stray `cdk destroy` could permanently and unrecoverably delete customer data, and at-rest data used an AWS-owned key with no CloudTrail auditability.
  
  Durability posture now comes from the stack-wide **`BlocksDefaults`** (see `BlocksPresets` in `@aws-blocks/core/cdk`): a `production` stack retains + protects + backs up its tables, a `sandbox` stack is disposable. So on a production deploy a table defaults to:
  
  - **Point-in-Time Recovery** enabled (`defaults.pointInTimeRecovery`) — 35-day continuous backups
  - **Deletion protection** enabled (`defaults.deletionProtection`)
  - **`RemovalPolicy.RETAIN`** (`defaults.removalPolicy`) — stack deletion orphans rather than destroys the table
  - **SSE-KMS** with the AWS-managed `aws/dynamodb` key (auditable, no per-key charge)
  
  Under the `sandbox` preset PITR, deletion protection, and RETAIN all flip off/`DESTROY`, so throwaway stacks stay cheap and `sandbox:destroy` tears down in one command. (The block no longer reads the `sandboxMode` context for durability — that posture flows through the stack `defaults`.)
  
  Every default is overridable per table:
  
  - `protection` (`'disposable' | 'retained' | 'locked'`) — one knob spanning removal policy + deletion protection, so the contradictory "protect + destroy" state can't be expressed. When set it wins over the stack `defaults`.
  - `pointInTimeRecovery` (`boolean | { retentionDays: number }`) — overrides `defaults.pointInTimeRecovery` for this table. `true` enables PITR with the default 35-day window, `false` disables it, and `{ retentionDays: n }` (1–35) pins a shorter window to trim backup cost. Window and on/off are one field, so "days set but PITR off" can't be expressed.
  - `encryption` (`'aws-managed' | 'customer-managed'`, or `DistributedTable.fromKmsKey(arn)` to share an existing customer-managed key across tables instead of provisioning one CMK each).
  
  Tables bound via `fromExisting()` are unaffected, and now emit a synth-time warning if durability/encryption options are passed alongside them (they're ignored). An unrecognized `protection`/`encryption` value, or an out-of-range `pointInTimeRecovery.retentionDays`, also warns at synth rather than silently falling back.
  
  > **Behavior change on next production deploy of an existing app:** the table will gain PITR, deletion protection, an SSE-KMS specification, and a `Retain` deletion policy (from the `production` preset). These are in-place updates (no table replacement). Because deletion protection becomes enabled, a future `cdk destroy` of a prod stack will refuse to delete the table until you relax it (`protection: 'disposable'`/`'retained'`). And because the removal policy is now `Retain`, deleting the stack orphans the table — redeploying the same app then fails with `Table already exists` until the orphaned table is removed or imported.
- 309a236: refactor(bb): attach IAM grants to the shared execution role
  
  Data and auth blocks now grant permissions to the shared Blocks execution role
  (`this.executionRole`) instead of the handler function directly. Grants land on
  the same role the handler assumes, so the effective runtime permissions are
  identical — this decouples IAM wiring from the concrete Lambda function ahead of
  the multi-compute model.
  
  For `bb-distributed-data`, the DSQL endpoint and region now flow through the
  config registry (loaded into `process.env` at cold start, like every other
  block) rather than being set as direct handler environment variables, and the
  migration Lambda maps the shared execution role's ARN.

### Patch Changes

- 7b4c62d: Add infrastructure `defaults` chosen once at the app entry point, replacing the per-block `sandboxMode` logic and the `RemovalPolicies`/`SandboxDisableDeletionProtection` mixin dance for removal-policy and deletion-protection.
  
  `@aws-blocks/core/cdk` now exports `BlocksDefaults` and the `BlocksPresets.sandbox` / `BlocksPresets.production` starting points. `BlocksStack.create` / `BlocksBackend.create` take a required `defaults` prop; start from a preset and override individual fields with a spread. `defaults` is anchored on the owning `BlocksStack`/`BlocksBackend` (resolved by walking up the construct tree, like `handler`/`executionRole`), so multiple backends in one stack each keep their own posture. Building Blocks read the resolved values via `scope.defaults`, and a per-block option always wins (`option ?? scope.defaults.field`).
  
  Adopted across the stateful Building Blocks: `bb-kv-store`, `bb-data`, `bb-distributed-data`, `bb-distributed-table`, and `bb-knowledge-base` now take their removal policy and deletion protection from `defaults` instead of reading the `sandboxMode` context themselves. (`bb-distributed-table` reads `defaults` directly for now; a richer per-block `protection` override lands with #282.)
  
  The `create-blocks-app` scaffolding templates are updated to pass `defaults: sandboxMode ? BlocksPresets.sandbox : BlocksPresets.production` (replacing the `RemovalPolicies`/`SandboxDisableDeletionProtection` mixin), so newly-generated apps satisfy the required prop.
  
  **Breaking:** `BlocksStack.create` / `BlocksBackend.create` now require a `defaults` field — pass `BlocksPresets.sandbox` or `BlocksPresets.production` (typically `sandboxMode ? BlocksPresets.sandbox : BlocksPresets.production`). The previously-shipped experimental `hardening` prop and its `resolve*` helpers are removed; log-retention, API throttling, access-logging and point-in-time-recovery move into `defaults` in follow-up, per-feature changes.

### Patch Changes

- 5b2aede: `DistributedTable`: reconcile reads with the schema via a new `readValidation` mode (default `'coerce'`).

  **Behavioral change to the read path (preview).** Writes always validated against `schema`, but reads (`get`, `getBatch`, `query`, `scan`) returned the raw stored value. After a schema change, a row written under the old schema no longer conformed to type `T`: a newly added field was absent from the read (so the value silently violated `T`, and a `.default()` was never applied or persisted on write-back), and a required-no-default field made the read-modify-write cycle (`get()` → mutate → `put()`) throw `ValidationFailed`.

  Reads now reconcile stored items with the schema via `readValidation?: 'off' | 'coerce' | 'strict'`:

  - **`'coerce'`** (default) — apply the schema (fill defaults, narrow types) so legacy rows conform to `T` and round-trip cleanly, **without dropping data**: the coerced output is deep-merged over the raw stored item, so attributes not in the current schema (older-schema fields, columns another writer owns) are preserved rather than silently stripped on a read-modify-write. Arrays are replaced wholesale. On a value that can't be coerced, return the raw value + log a warning — **never throws**.
  - **`'strict'`** — throw `ValidationFailed` on any non-conforming item (opt-in; treats a mismatch as corruption).
  - **`'off'`** — return the raw stored value with no validation (the previous default behavior).

  ```ts
  const orders = new DistributedTable(scope, "orders", {
    schema: orderSchemaV2, // adds `currency: z.string().default('USD')`
    key: { partitionKey: "orderId" },
    // readValidation: 'coerce' is the default
  });
  const order = await orders.get({ orderId: "o1" }); // legacy row → currency: 'USD'
  await orders.put({ ...order, total: 20 }); // conforms to T; round-trips
  ```

  Migration note: the default is now `'coerce'` (previously reads returned raw values). Pass `readValidation: 'off'` to restore raw reads. Coercion is best-effort and validator-dependent — transform-bearing schemas (e.g. Zod) fill defaults and narrow types; check-only Standard Schema validators pass values through unchanged. `null` (a missing item) is untouched in all modes.

### Patch Changes

- ba3bf7b: docs: add per-package DESIGN.md documents

  Adds a `DESIGN.md` to each building-block package describing its architecture, API surface, mock implementation, and key design decisions.

  - Each document is cross-checked against the current source so identifiers, environment variables, error names, and described behavior match the implementation.
  - Each `DESIGN.md` is listed in its package's `files` array so it ships on npm alongside `README.md`.
  - For consistency, `bb-auth-cognito`'s document lives at the package root like every other package.
  - Bumps the umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` package so its bundled `docs/` — assembled from these block READMEs at build time — republishes with a fresh version. Its packed content changes whenever the READMEs change, but the version was previously left untouched, which tripped the publish integrity guard.
