### Minor Changes

- f1d2cd5: feat(bb-realtime): production Realtime middleware now auto-reconnects and resubscribes after an unexpected WebSocket drop
  
  The production (`aws-middleware`) Realtime transport previously gave up when the WebSocket
  closed unexpectedly (e.g. an API Gateway idle timeout or an abnormal `1006` closure) — only the
  local mock middleware recovered. It now transparently reconnects with exponential backoff (capped
  retries), rebuilds the socket URL from the retained connection token, and resubscribes every active
  channel by replaying its stored per-channel token so the server can re-authorize. The keep-alive
  ping timer is re-armed on the fresh socket. Only a client-initiated teardown — unsubscribing the last
  channel (or the internal reset/give-up paths) — is treated as terminal; an unexpected drop reconnects on ANY close code, including a clean `1000`/`1005`.
  
  `SubscribeOptions` gains an optional `onReconnect` callback, fired once after a successful
  reconnect for a channel once THAT channel's resubscribe has been re-confirmed by the server
  (after the corresponding `onDisconnect` for the drop that triggered it; never on the initial
  subscribe). Callbacks are routed per-channel: a channel whose resubscribe is rejected (e.g. a
  stale replayed token) receives `onDisconnect('error')` and NOT `onReconnect`, and never sees a
  sibling channel's rejection.
  
  This change is behavior-additive: existing `subscribe(handler)` / `SubscribeOptions` callers are
  unaffected and need no changes. Note for maintainers: on a `0.x` package this ships as a `minor`
  per this repo's convention (minor is the breaking/behavior-change channel pre-1.0), since it alters
  the runtime reconnect behavior of the production transport.
- de3c17c: feat(bb-realtime): refresh channel/connect tokens on reconnect so subscriptions outlive token TTLs
  
  Adds an optional `refresh` callback to `SubscribeOptions`:
  
  ```ts
  refresh?: () => Promise<RealtimeChannelDescriptor>;
  ```
  
  A reconnect opens a *new* WebSocket, which means API Gateway re-checks the
  connect token (carried in the socket URL, validated at `$connect`, ~2h TTL) and
  the server re-checks the channel token on resubscribe (~1h TTL, per `utils.ts`
  `mintChannelToken`'s 3600s default). Until now both the AWS and mock middlewares
  replayed the *original* stored `wsUrl` + channel token on every reconnect, so a
  reconnect more than ~1h after the descriptor was minted failed (the channel
  token had expired and the resubscribe was rejected), and more than ~2h after
  failed to even open the socket (`$connect` 403). Token minting is server-only
  (it needs the signing secret), so the client cannot re-sign locally — it must
  re-call the server method that produced the descriptor.
  
  When `refresh` is provided, both middlewares now call it **before** opening the
  reconnect socket (never on the initial subscribe), then open with the fresh
  connect token in the URL and resubscribe each channel with its fresh channel
  token. `refresh` is registered per-channel: a connection multiplexing several
  channels re-mints every live channel's token in parallel on reconnect (the
  instance-scoped connect token taken from any one of them), and a channel whose
  refresh fails falls back to its stored token with a channel-scoped rejection
  rather than dropping its siblings. The refresh-before-open ordering is required
  because the connect token lives in the socket URL and is validated at `$connect`,
  so it must be fresh at construction time. If `refresh` rejects, the middleware
  does not crash: it surfaces the failure via the existing `onDisconnect('error')`
  path and falls back to the normal exponential-backoff reconnect so a later
  attempt can retry.
  
  Fully backward compatible: with no `refresh` callback, a reconnect replays the
  stored `wsUrl` + token exactly as before, and the initial (non-reconnect) open
  stays synchronous and unchanged.
  
  This is a `minor` bump. `@aws-blocks/bb-realtime` is pre-1.0, where `minor` is
  this repo's signal for an API addition; the new option is optional and additive,
  and existing behavior is unchanged when it is omitted.

### Patch Changes

- 757d4a9: feat(core): forward the native client user-agent into the AWS SDK user agent
  
  Native runtimes send `x-blocks-user-agent: aws-blocks-<lang>/<version>` on the RPC
  request. `@aws-blocks/core` validates it against a strict grammar (length-capped,
  dropped silently when malformed), carries it per request in an `AsyncLocalStorage`,
  and exports `installClientUserAgent`, an SDK middleware that appends the validated
  token to the outgoing user agent. The 12 participating Building Blocks install it,
  so native attribution rides the SDK user-agent chain AWS service telemetry already
  counts. The Kotlin runtime already sends the header, so Kotlin
  callers are attributed as soon as this ships; Swift and Dart follow.
- cbedb3c: fix(bb-realtime): validate publish size against the 128 KiB message quota, not the 32 KiB frame quota
  
  `publish` rejected payloads above 32 KiB, API Gateway's WebSocket *frame* size — but a
  message is reassembled from multiple frames, so the real limit is the 128 KiB message
  quota. Messages between 32 KiB and 128 KiB were refused client-side even though API
  Gateway would have delivered them. The serialized envelope is now checked against
  131,072 bytes: 131,072 is accepted and 131,073 is rejected.
- a23b8d8: Stop leaking raw backend exception details in RPC error responses, while forwarding Building Block error names AND their BB-authored messages.
  
  `errorResponseFromCatch` sorts a caught throw into three cases: an `ApiError` crosses the wire verbatim (status, `message`, `name`, `retriable`); a Building Block error carrying the wire-safe brand forwards BOTH its BB `name` in `data.name` AND its BB-authored `message` (per D-003, the wire carries `name` alongside `message`), so `isBlocksError()` keeps matching on the client and the caller sees the real, actionable message ("Batch contains 150 payloads, exceeds the 100 limit"); and everything else — a driver/SDK exception, a bare `Error`, or a non-`Error` throw — collapses to a nameless generic `500` / `"Internal error"`. The full error (including `cause`) is still logged server-side in every case.
  
  The brand is a non-enumerable symbol stamped by core's new `brandBlocksError()` helper, and the serializer keys the name-and-message-forwarding decision on that brand rather than on `.name !== 'Error'`. Every Building Block that mints a named error now routes it through that one helper — core's `blocksError()`, each package's own local `blocksError()`, and the inline named-error sites across the runtime and mock layers — so a BB error keeps its `name` and message on the wire no matter which package or layer threw it. A raw driver exception whose class name happens to be non-generic (`PostgresError`, `DynamoDBServiceException`) is never branded, so neither its class name nor its raw message ever reaches the client.
  
  The load-bearing invariant, now that messages cross the wire: **a branded error's message must never embed raw driver/SDK text.** Two message-embedding sites are therefore given stable, BB-authored messages (`bb-kv-store` and `bb-distributed-table`'s item-too-large remaps, which previously copied DynamoDB's raw `err.message`), keeping the raw driver error only as `cause`.
  
  Re-tag paths are branded, with a stable message. The catch-all re-tag paths in `bb-data` (`wrapError` / `translatePgError`) and `bb-distributed-data` (`translateDsqlError`) — which classify a caught driver error as `QueryFailed` / `ConnectionFailed` — now build a fresh BRANDED error carrying the BB `name` and a stable BB message (e.g. "The database query failed"), keeping the raw driver error as `cause`. This preserves the client-side `isBlocksError(e, DatabaseErrors.QueryFailed | .ConnectionFailed)` retry contract the `bb-data` README teaches for auto-pause-resume, and — because the message is a stable BB string, not the driver's — a re-tagged error still never leaks driver internals over the wire. The 40001 / 23505 conflict paths already crossed as `ApiError` (409) with stable messages and are unchanged. Also branded in this pass: `bb-auth-oidc`'s `InvalidRelayError` (a class-field error not reached by the `.name =` sweep) and `bb-distributed-data`'s mock DDL-guard error (name `DsqlPermissionException`, the internal `DSQL_PERMISSION_ERROR_NAME`; now branded with a stable message, its name kept internal and mock-only, not a public `DistributedDatabaseErrors` constant).
  
  The two `bb-realtime` client-middleware `brandBlocksError` calls are commented as intentionally inert (a client-side subscription rejection matches on `err.name`, never routes through the server serializer). The realtime e2e's `ConnectionFailedException` assertions run against `channel.subscribe()` in-process on the client, not across the RPC serializer.
  
  ## Breaking change (why `@aws-blocks/core` is a minor)
  
  App code that throws a plain `Error('Todo not found')` from an API method now surfaces as a generic `500` / `"Internal error"` on the client instead of the raw message (a customer-defined `Error` also loses its `.name`). This is the intended safety net — an unbranded throw is treated as an unhandled internal error — but it changes client-visible behavior, so `@aws-blocks/core` ships as a minor (we are pre-1.0). To send a specific status, name, and message to the client, throw an `ApiError`:
  
  ```ts
  // before — message collapses to "Internal error" on the client
  throw new Error('Todo not found');
  
  // after — status, message, and name all reach the client
  throw new ApiError('Todo not found', 404, { name: 'TodoNotFoundException' });
  ```
  
  Building Block errors (`isBlocksError` / `blocksError`) are unaffected — their name and message continue to cross the wire.

### Patch Changes

- 5eee114: Add npm keywords for discoverability via `npm search keywords:aws-blocks`
  
  Every published package now carries an npm `keywords` array: the shared `aws-blocks`
  discovery tag plus 2–5 functional keywords describing the package's domain and the
  AWS services it uses (e.g. `realtime`, `websocket`, `pubsub` for `bb-realtime`;
  `ci-cd`, `pipelines`, `deployment` for `pipeline`). Metadata only — no runtime,
  API, or behavior change.
- 6496713: Simplify VPC implementation: replace `registerVpcEndpoint` (instanceof-based) with two explicit methods (`registerVpcGatewayEndpoint` / `registerVpcInterfaceEndpoint`), simplify `BlocksVpcOptions` to `{ network, subnets?, provisionEndpoints? }`, and strip persistent test VPC to bare minimum.
- 6496713: feat(core): constructor-forced VPC requirements, lazy VPC, and Database subnet control
  
  Continues the VPC review follow-ups (net-new, unreleased VPC feature).
  
  **Building Blocks declare VPC requirements via the constructor, not a method.**
  `BuildingBlockScope` is no longer abstract: its constructor takes the block's VPC
  requirements (a value, or a callback for values that depend on `fullId`) and
  registers them in a central per-stack registry. This keeps the compile-time
  forcing the previous `abstract getVpcRequirements()` provided — a block can't
  silently omit its requirements — without a standing method on every subclass, and
  gives the framework one place to read, deduplicate, and answer "does anything here
  need a VPC?". All Building Blocks were migrated to pass requirements to `super()`.
  
  **VPC is now a derived resource, not a hard prerequisite.** A block that cannot
  function without a VPC declares `requiresVpc: true`; when one is needed and the
  customer didn't bring their own, Blocks lazily creates a single shared VPC
  (generalizing the create-if-absent behavior `bb-data` already used for Aurora) and
  emits a notice about the NAT cost. Setting `defaults.vpc = { network }` remains the
  bring-your-own override.
  
  **`Database` accepts an optional `subnets` placement.** A CDK-free mirror of
  `ec2.SubnetSelection` (tier as a string, subnets by id) lets you steer where the
  Aurora cluster lands — for a bring-your-own VPC that lacks an isolated tier, or a
  compliance requirement to use specific subnets. Omit it to keep the default
  (prefer isolated, fall back to `private-with-egress`).
- 302090a: Local dev server: handle raw-socket errors during the WebSocket upgrade instead of crashing.
  
  The `upgrade` handlers routed the HTTP upgrade without attaching an `'error'` listener to the raw `net.Socket` first. A stale WebSocket client that reset its connection inside the upgrade window emitted ECONNRESET on a socket with no handler, so Node's default unhandled-`'error'` behaviour killed the dev server process right after port bind. Both upgrade paths now attach `socket.on('error', () => socket.destroy())` as their first statement, the HTTP server answers malformed/aborted requests via a `clientError` handler, and the `noServer` `WebSocketServer` logs server-level errors rather than throwing. The fix is scoped to the vulnerable socket — a genuine error anywhere else still crashes as before.

### Minor Changes

- 4a830a6: feat: route event-block resources to their resolved compute
  
  AsyncJob, CronJob, and Realtime now attach their compute-bound resources to a
  compute resolved at synth rather than the stack's shared handler:
  
  - AsyncJob attaches its SQS event source to the resolved compute's function;
  - CronJob points its EventBridge Scheduler target at the resolved compute's function;
  - Realtime binds its shared WebSocket API integrations to the stack's **default**
    compute (its routes are a stack-level singleton) and grants `postToConnection`
    to the shared execution role, so `publish()` works from any compute.
  
  Each block requires a Lambda compute today and fails at synth with a typed
  `UnsupportedCompute` error (assertable via `isBlocksError`) on any other type.
  The check uses a duplicate-copy-safe brand (`LambdaCompute.isLambdaCompute`,
  backed by a `Symbol.for` marker) instead of `instanceof`, so it does not misfire
  when two copies of `bb-lambda-compute` resolve in one dependency tree.
  
  On the default single-Lambda setup the resolved/default compute is the stack's
  default, whose function is the shared handler — so this is non-breaking with no
  change to synthesized infrastructure. AsyncJob also grants SQS send to the shared
  execution role rather than the handler directly.
  
  New public surface (hence `minor`):
  
  - `@aws-blocks/core` exports `blocksError(name, message)` (the producer half of
    the `isBlocksError` contract) and `sanitizeConfigKey(id)` from `./bb-utils`
    (the single env-var-key sanitizer both config writers and runtime readers use).
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-lambda-compute` adds a `./cdk` subpath exposing the CDK-typed
    `LambdaCompute` and its `LambdaCompute.isLambdaCompute` guard.
  - `bb-async-job` / `bb-cron-job` / `bb-realtime` add an `UnsupportedCompute`
    error member.
  
  `@aws-blocks/bb-agent` builds AsyncJob and Realtime internally, so its CDK test
  moves onto the `BlocksStack.create` harness instead of a handler-only stub.
  Test-only change — no runtime behavior change to the Agent.

### Patch Changes

- c45eb92: Extend stack-wide `BlocksDefaults` (introduced in the Infrastructure Options work) with three additive fields, and adopt them across the Blocks-managed infrastructure. Each field is read independently via `option ?? scope.defaults.field` — a per-block option always wins, and no field is derived from another.
  
  `@aws-blocks/core/cdk` now adds to `BlocksDefaults` (and both `BlocksPresets`):
  
  - `logRetention: RetentionDays` — how long Blocks-managed CloudWatch log groups keep events. Preset sandbox `ONE_WEEK`, production `ONE_YEAR`.
  - `throttling: { rateLimit, burstLimit }` — request-rate limits applied to every Blocks API Gateway stage. Preset sandbox `200 / 400`, production `1000 / 2000`.
  - `accessLogging: boolean` — structured JSON access logs on every Blocks API Gateway stage. **Off by default in both presets** (opt-in), because enabling it mutates the account/region-level API Gateway CloudWatch role singleton.
  
  Also newly exported from `@aws-blocks/core/cdk`: the `BlocksThrottling` type and `ensureApiGatewayAccount()` (provisions the account-level API Gateway CloudWatch Logs role once per stack). `Scope` gains a `handlerLogGroup` getter for the shared handler log group.
  
  **Log retention** — Blocks-managed log groups now follow `defaults.logRetention` instead of AWS's infinite default: the shared handler Lambda (now owned by `BlocksStack`/`BlocksBackend` as `scope.handlerLogGroup`), the `bb-distributed-table` GSI-manager Lambdas, the `bb-distributed-data` DSQL migration Lambda, the `bb-data` Aurora migration Lambda, and the `bb-app-setting` secret-init Lambda. `bb-logger` reconfigures the shared handler group's retention — **only when an explicit per-Logger `retention` is set** (a bare `Logger` no longer writes it back, so it can't clobber another Logger's value) — rather than creating its own `/aws/lambda/<fn>` group. (Note: the framework `custom-resources.Provider` Lambdas these BBs wrap still use AWS's default retention — the L2 `Provider` exposes no log-group/retention override.)
  
  **Throttling** — applied to the core REST API stage and the `bb-realtime` WebSocket stage. On a WebSocket stage the throttle unit is messages/second across the connection.
  
  **Access logging** — when enabled, each stage writes structured JSON access logs to a dedicated CloudWatch log group (retention = `defaults.logRetention`, removal policy = `defaults.removalPolicy` so production **RETAIN**s the audit trail on teardown). The account-level API Gateway CloudWatch Logs role is provisioned once per stack and shared across stages.
  
  **⚠️ Behavior changes on upgrade:**
  - **Throttling now caps the core REST API and WebSocket stages.** Before this change these stages had no stage-level throttle (they ran at the API Gateway account default, ~10k rps). After upgrade, sandbox is capped at 200 rps / 400 burst and production at 1000 rps / 2000 burst. Apps serving above the production ceiling will see `429`s — raise it with a per-stack `throttling` override (`defaults: { ...BlocksPresets.production, throttling: { rateLimit, burstLimit } }`).
  - **The shared handler Lambda log group changes.** The handler previously logged to Lambda's auto-created `/aws/lambda/<fn>` group (infinite retention); it now logs to a framework-owned group with the default retention. On upgrade the old auto group is left orphaned in CloudWatch (unmanaged, still infinite) — delete it manually if you want its history/cost gone. Likewise a `bb-logger`-created retention group from a prior version is replaced.
  - **Access logging** is **opt-in (off in both presets)**. When enabled it requires the account-level API Gateway CloudWatch Logs role — an account/region-level singleton, so enabling it is safe for **one Blocks stack per region** (see `ensureApiGatewayAccount()` for the multi-stack teardown caveat). It defaults off (rather than on for production) so an upgrade never mutates that account-wide singleton without an explicit opt-in.
  - **`BlocksDefaults` gains three required fields** (`logRetention`, `throttling`, `accessLogging`). Apps that spread a `BlocksPresets` preset (the documented path) are unaffected; code that hand-rolls a literal `BlocksDefaults` object will need to add the new fields to compile.
  
  `bb-dashboard` now points its log widgets at the framework-owned handler log
  group (`scope.handlerLogGroup.logGroupName`) instead of reconstructing
  `/aws/lambda/<fn>` — the handler now writes to a dedicated group with a
  CDK-generated name, so the old convention would leave the "Recent Errors" /
  "Log Volume" widgets querying an empty group.
  
  Hosting adoption of these defaults (SSR REST API + compute log groups) ships in a separate change.

  - Each document is cross-checked against the current source so identifiers, environment variables, error names, and described behavior match the implementation.
  - Each `DESIGN.md` is listed in its package's `files` array so it ships on npm alongside `README.md`.
  - For consistency, `bb-auth-cognito`'s document lives at the package root like every other package.
  - Bumps the umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` package so its bundled `docs/` — assembled from these block READMEs at build time — republishes with a fresh version. Its packed content changes whenever the READMEs change, but the version was previously left untouched, which tripped the publish integrity guard.
