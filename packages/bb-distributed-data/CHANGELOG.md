### Patch Changes

- b0be240: Upgrade PGlite from `^0.2.0` to `^0.5.8` to address the `_pg_initdb` WASM init crash seen on Node 22 / CI.
  
  On the CI runner (Node 22), PGlite's WASM `initdb` traps with `RuntimeError: unreachable` at `_pg_initdb`; the trapped instance is unrecoverable, so a Database or DistributedDatabase block whose init hits the trap fails to start. The `0.3.7` "wasm runtime exception" fix (electric-sql/pglite#753) did NOT resolve it — an upgrade to `0.3.16` was verified to still trap. PGlite `0.4.0` re-architected initdb into a separate module and `0.4.3` added an initial-memory-size control, so the plausible fix for an initdb-path trap is in the 0.4.x+ line, not 0.3.x. This moves to the current `0.5.8`.
  
  The query/transaction API surface the engines use (`new PGlite(dir)`, `query().rows`, `query().affectedRows`, `close()`, `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`) and the structural data-directory markers (`PG_VERSION`, `base`, `global`, `global/pg_control`) are unchanged on `0.5.8`, so no engine code changes are required. Note: a `.bb-data` directory created by `0.2` (embedded PG16) is **not** forward-compatible with `0.5.8` (embedded PG18) — `hasInitializedPgliteDataDir` keys on marker *presence*, not the `PG_VERSION` contents, so a stale PG16 dir is treated as initialized and the mismatch surfaces at first query with no auto-recovery. Local-dev only (CI starts clean and `.bb-data` is gitignored); a dev with an old dir must delete it and let `0.5.8` recreate it.
  
  Note: the trap does not reproduce locally (it is CI-runner-specific), so the crash fix is verified in CI by the `oidc-dsql-notes` / `sql-kb-catalog` dead_server rate; the API compatibility is verified locally.
- a23b8d8: Stop leaking raw backend exception details in RPC error responses, while forwarding Building Block error names AND their BB-authored messages.
  
  `errorResponseFromCatch` sorts a caught throw into three cases: an `ApiError` crosses the wire verbatim (status, `message`, `name`, `retriable`); a Building Block error carrying the wire-safe brand forwards BOTH its BB `name` in `data.name` AND its BB-authored `message` (per D-003, the wire carries `name` alongside `message`), so `isBlocksError()` keeps matching on the client and the caller sees the real, actionable message ("Batch contains 150 payloads, exceeds the 100 limit"); and everything else — a driver/SDK exception, a bare `Error`, or a non-`Error` throw — collapses to a nameless generic `500` / `"Internal error"`. The full error (including `cause`) is still logged server-side in every case.
  
  The brand is a non-enumerable symbol stamped by core's new `brandBlocksError()` helper, and the serializer keys the name-and-message-forwarding decision on that brand rather than on `.name !== 'Error'`. Every Building Block that mints a named error now routes it through that one helper — core's `blocksError()`, each package's own local `blocksError()`, and the inline named-error sites across the runtime and mock layers — so a BB error keeps its `name` and message on the wire no matter which package or layer threw it. A raw driver exception whose class name happens to be non-generic (`PostgresError`, `DynamoDBServiceException`) is never branded, so neither its class name nor its raw message ever reaches the client.
  
  The load-bearing invariant, now that messages cross the wire: **a branded error's message must never embed raw driver/SDK text.** Two message-embedding sites are therefore given stable, BB-authored messages (`bb-kv-store` and `bb-distributed-table`'s item-too-large remaps, which previously copied DynamoDB's raw `err.message`), keeping the raw driver error only as `cause`.
  
  Re-tag paths are branded, with a stable message. The catch-all re-tag paths in `bb-data` (`wrapError` / `translatePgError`) and `bb-distributed-data` (`translateDsqlError`) — which classify a caught driver error as `QueryFailed` / `ConnectionFailed` — now build a fresh BRANDED error carrying the BB `name` and a stable BB message (e.g. "The database query failed"), keeping the raw driver error as `cause`. This preserves the client-side `isBlocksError(e, DatabaseErrors.QueryFailed | .ConnectionFailed)` retry contract the `bb-data` README teaches for auto-pause-resume, and — because the message is a stable BB string, not the driver's — a re-tagged error still never leaks driver internals over the wire. The 40001 / 23505 conflict paths already crossed as `ApiError` (409) with stable messages and are unchanged. Also branded in this pass: `bb-auth-oidc`'s `InvalidRelayError` (a class-field error not reached by the `.name =` sweep) and `bb-distributed-data`'s mock DDL-guard error (name `DsqlPermissionException`, the internal `DSQL_PERMISSION_ERROR_NAME`; now branded with a stable message, its name kept internal and mock-only, not a public `DistributedDatabaseErrors` constant).
  
  The two `bb-realtime` client-middleware `brandBlocksError` calls are commented as intentionally inert (a client-side subscription rejection matches on `err.name`, never routes through the server serializer). The realtime e2e's `ConnectionFailedException` assertions run against `channel.subscribe()` in-process on the client, not across the RPC serializer.
  
  ## Breaking change (why `@aws-blocks/core` is a minor)
  
  App code that throws a plain `Error('Todo not found')` from an API method now surfaces as a generic `500` / `"Internal error"` on the client instead of the raw message (a customer-defined `Error` also loses its `.name`). This is the intended safety net — an unbranded throw is treated as an unhandled internal error — but it changes client-visible behavior, so `@aws-blocks/core` ships as a minor (we are pre-1.0). To send a specific status, name, and message to the client, throw an `ApiError`:
  
  ```ts
  // before — message collapses to "Internal error" on the client
  throw new Error('Todo not found');
  
  // after — status, message, and name all reach the client
  throw new ApiError('Todo not found', 404, { name: 'TodoNotFoundException' });
  ```
  
  Building Block errors (`isBlocksError` / `blocksError`) are unaffected — their name and message continue to cross the wire.

### Minor Changes

- 21443ba: fix(data): map optimistic-concurrency conflicts to JSON-RPC 409 (Conflict) instead of 500
  
  Optimistic-concurrency / conditional-write conflicts now surface to clients as
  JSON-RPC error **code 409 (Conflict)** instead of a generic **500**. Previously
  these conflicts were thrown as plain named `Error`s (or re-thrown raw driver
  errors), and the JSON-RPC serializer maps any non-`ApiError` to 500 — so a
  routine, expected conflict was indistinguishable from an internal server error.
  
  Each affected conflict is now an `ApiError` with `status: 409`, so on the client
  `error.status === 409`. The structured `error.name` is preserved end-to-end, so
  `isBlocksError(e, ...)` keeps matching by name on both server and client, and the
  existing typed error constants are unchanged:
  
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-kv-store` — a failed `ifNotExists` / `ifExists` /
    `ifValueEquals` write or delete (`KVStoreErrors.ConditionalCheckFailed`). The
    AWS runtime now also normalizes DynamoDB's raw `ConditionalCheckFailedException`
    on both `put` and `delete`, matching the mock.
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-distributed-table` — a failed `ifNotExists` / `ifExists` /
    `ifFieldEquals` condition (`DistributedTableErrors.ConditionalCheckFailed`),
    in both mock and AWS `put`/`delete`.
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-distributed-data` — a DSQL serialization failure / OCC
    conflict, SQLSTATE `40001` (`DistributedDatabaseErrors.SerializationFailure`),
    in both the mock and real engines.
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-data` — a serializable-isolation conflict, SQLSTATE `40001`
    (`DatabaseErrors.SerializationFailure`), across the PGlite, pg-client, and
    Data API engines.
  
  The `retriable` flag is scoped to genuine optimistic-lock conflicts: it is
  `true` for value/field-equals conflicts (`ifValueEquals` / `ifFieldEquals`) and
  the 40001 serialization failures, and omitted/`false` for existence/uniqueness
  assertions (`ifNotExists`, `ifExists`), where a blind identical retry would fail
  identically. Status (409) and `error.name` are unchanged in every case.
  
  This is a `minor` bump. Every package here is pre-1.0, where `minor` is this
  repo's signal for a change that can alter existing behavior: callers that
  branched on `error.status === 500` for these conflicts (or on the JSON-RPC error
  code) will now see `409`. Code that matches conflicts by name via
  `isBlocksError` — the documented pattern — is unaffected.
  
  `@aws-blocks/core` and `@aws-blocks/blocks` get a `patch` bump for a docs-only
  change: a clarifying sentence was added to the `ApiError.retriable` JSDoc
  (no behavior or API change).
- a47d71c: fix(data): map duplicate-key unique-constraint violations to JSON-RPC 409 (Conflict) instead of 500
  
  A duplicate-key / unique-constraint violation (SQLSTATE `23505`,
  `UniqueConstraintViolation`) now surfaces to clients as JSON-RPC error
  **code 409 (Conflict)** instead of a generic **500**. Previously the engine
  translators set `error.name` on the raw driver error and re-threw a plain named
  `Error`; the JSON-RPC serializer maps any non-`ApiError` to 500, so a routine,
  expected duplicate-key conflict was indistinguishable from an internal server
  error. This mirrors the `40001`/OCC → 409 mapping already established for these
  Blocks.
  
  Each affected conflict is now an `ApiError` with `status: 409`, so on the client
  `error.status === 409`. The structured `error.name` is preserved end-to-end, so
  `isBlocksError(e, DatabaseErrors.UniqueConstraintViolation)` (and the
  `DistributedDatabaseErrors` equivalent) keeps matching by name on both server and
  client; the typed error constants are unchanged.
  
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-data` — a duplicate-key violation (SQLSTATE `23505`,
    `DatabaseErrors.UniqueConstraintViolation`) across the PGlite, pg-client, and
    Data API engines (both the SQLState-parsed and message-matched Data API paths),
    routed through a shared `uniqueConstraintConflict()` helper.
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-distributed-data` — a DSQL duplicate-key violation (SQLSTATE
    `23505`, `DistributedDatabaseErrors.UniqueConstraintViolation`) in
    `translateDsqlError`, in both the mock and real engines.
  
  The conflict is **not** flagged `retriable`: a duplicate key is deterministic, so
  a blind retry of the same insert fails identically (unlike the `40001`
  serialization failures, which stay retriable). The client-visible message is a
  fixed, stable string; the raw driver text (which can name columns / constraints)
  is retained only as `cause` for server-side diagnostics. Genuine infrastructure
  errors (`ConnectionFailed`, `QueryFailed`) are unchanged and correctly stay 500,
  and the `SerializationFailure`/OCC paths are untouched.
  
  This is a `minor` bump. Both data packages are pre-1.0, where `minor` is this
  repo's signal for a change that can alter existing behavior: callers that
  branched on `error.status === 500` for these conflicts (or on the JSON-RPC error
  code) will now see `409`. Code that matches conflicts by name via
  `isBlocksError` — the documented pattern — is unaffected.
  
  `@aws-blocks/blocks` gets a `patch` bump because it re-exports `bb-data` and
  `bb-distributed-data` (satisfies the umbrella publish guard); no umbrella source
  changed.
  
  Fixes #508.

### Patch Changes

- e2c3c62: fix(bb-distributed-data): re-run the DSQL role grant when the app's IAM role is replaced
  
  `DistributedDatabase` maps the app's IAM role ARN to a DSQL database role with
  `AWS IAM GRANT`. The migration/provisioning CustomResource is documented as running
  on every deploy so the mapping "stays in sync if the app Lambda's IAM role is
  recreated", but its properties were `{ migrationsHash, dbRole }` only — the role ARN
  reached the Lambda as an environment variable and nothing else.
  
  CloudFormation re-invokes a CustomResource only when its **properties** change. When
  an IAM role replacement changed the ARN while migrations stayed the same, both
  properties were unchanged, so CloudFormation skipped the resource entirely. The
  Lambda's `APP_ROLE_ARN` env var was updated but the function was never called, leaving
  the DSQL grant pointing at the old, deleted ARN. Every query then failed with SQLSTATE
  `28000` (`invalid_authorization_specification`, "unable to accept connection, access
  denied") while the deploy itself reported success and the IAM policy still showed a
  correct `dsql:DbConnect` — the breakage lived in DSQL's internal role mapping, which is
  invisible from the CloudFormation layer.
  
  `appRoleArn` is now a CustomResource property, so a role replacement re-invokes the
  resource and `provisionAppRole()` re-issues the grant as part of the deploy. The value
  is a CDK token, so it differs only when the role is genuinely replaced — this does not
  force the resource to run on every deploy.
  
  This was latent from the initial version and stayed dormant while each Lambda kept its
  own stable execution role. It surfaced once the shared execution role landed (#320,
  #341): upgrading `@aws-blocks/core` across that range replaces the per-Lambda
  `HandlerServiceRole` with the shared `BlocksRole`, which is exactly the role-ARN change
  that the CustomResource failed to notice.
  
  `@aws-blocks/blocks` gets a `patch` bump because it re-exports `bb-distributed-data`
  (satisfies the umbrella publish guard); no umbrella source changed.
  
  Fixes #556.
- 5eee114: Add npm keywords for discoverability via `npm search keywords:aws-blocks`
  
  Every published package now carries an npm `keywords` array: the shared `aws-blocks`
  discovery tag plus 2–5 functional keywords describing the package's domain and the
  AWS services it uses (e.g. `realtime`, `websocket`, `pubsub` for `bb-realtime`;
  `ci-cd`, `pipelines`, `deployment` for `pipeline`). Metadata only — no runtime,
  API, or behavior change.
- 6496713: Simplify VPC implementation: replace `registerVpcEndpoint` (instanceof-based) with two explicit methods (`registerVpcGatewayEndpoint` / `registerVpcInterfaceEndpoint`), simplify `BlocksVpcOptions` to `{ network, subnets?, provisionEndpoints? }`, and strip persistent test VPC to bare minimum.
- 6496713: feat(core): constructor-forced VPC requirements, lazy VPC, and Database subnet control
  
  Continues the VPC review follow-ups (net-new, unreleased VPC feature).
  
  **Building Blocks declare VPC requirements via the constructor, not a method.**
  `BuildingBlockScope` is no longer abstract: its constructor takes the block's VPC
  requirements (a value, or a callback for values that depend on `fullId`) and
  registers them in a central per-stack registry. This keeps the compile-time
  forcing the previous `abstract getVpcRequirements()` provided — a block can't
  silently omit its requirements — without a standing method on every subclass, and
  gives the framework one place to read, deduplicate, and answer "does anything here
  need a VPC?". All Building Blocks were migrated to pass requirements to `super()`.
  
  **VPC is now a derived resource, not a hard prerequisite.** A block that cannot
  function without a VPC declares `requiresVpc: true`; when one is needed and the
  customer didn't bring their own, Blocks lazily creates a single shared VPC
  (generalizing the create-if-absent behavior `bb-data` already used for Aurora) and
  emits a notice about the NAT cost. Setting `defaults.vpc = { network }` remains the
  bring-your-own override.
  
  **`Database` accepts an optional `subnets` placement.** A CDK-free mirror of
  `ec2.SubnetSelection` (tier as a string, subnets by id) lets you steer where the
  Aurora cluster lands — for a bring-your-own VPC that lacks an isolated tier, or a
  compliance requirement to use specific subnets. Omit it to keep the default
  (prefer isolated, fall back to `private-with-egress`).
- 6496713: fix(core): harden VPC integration — scoped endpoint SG, runtime-subnet validation, instructive subnet errors
  
  Second-pass hardening of VPC support based on review feedback.
  
  **Interface endpoints are no longer reachable from the whole VPC.** They now get
  a dedicated security group that allows 443 only from the Blocks Lambda SG, and
  the endpoints are created with `open: false` to suppress CDK's default
  "allow 443 from the entire VPC CIDR" rule. On a bring-your-own VPC this stops
  unrelated workloads from reaching every Blocks interface endpoint.
  
  **`VpcRequirements.subnetRole` is replaced by `requiresEgress`.** The old field
  was declared but never consumed. `requiresEgress` expresses a real, validated
  capability: whether the BB's parent runtime (the shared handler Lambda) must be
  able to reach the internet. `finalizeVpc` validates it against the runtime's
  actual placement and fails synth with an actionable message on a mismatch — it
  never relocates the runtime (that's the customer's explicit choice).
  `bb-distributed-data` (DSQL) declares `requiresEgress: true`, turning a
  previously silent runtime failure (DSQL in isolated subnets deploys clean, then
  every call times out) into a build-time error.
  
  **`VpcContext.selectSubnets` is now instructive.** It takes the requesting BB and
  verifies the VPC actually has the requested subnet tier, throwing a BB-named,
  actionable error instead of the opaque CDK "no subnet groups" error. It accepts
  an explicit `{ fallback }` so a BB can opt into graceful degradation (e.g. Aurora
  over the Data API works from `private-with-egress` when there is no isolated
  tier); the downgrade is never silent. `bb-data` uses this.
  
  **Other fixes:** Lambda placement now fails fast with an actionable error when a
  VPC has no private-with-egress tier and none was specified; `bb-data` drops its
  unused 5432 ingress rule (Aurora is reached over the RDS Data API, not a socket);
  removed `any` casts from the Lambda props and endpoint/CIDR handling; de-duplicated
  the VPC/non-VPC branches in `BlocksStack`.
  
  All pre-1.0 `patch` bumps — no breaking changes to shipped, consumed API
  (`subnetRole` had no consumers). The umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` re-exports the
  affected types.
- 6496713: fix(core): VPC review follow-ups — egress capability, endpoint trim, S3 gateway
  
  Refines VPC support based on review feedback (all changes to the net-new,
  unreleased VPC feature).
  
  **`VpcRequirements.runtimeSubnet` becomes `requiresEgress?: boolean`.** A BB's
  runtime need is a capability ("my code must reach the internet"), not a specific
  subnet tier. Modeling it as a single role wrongly rejected a valid placement
  (e.g. a BB needing egress placed in a `public` subnet). `finalizeVpc` now resolves
  whether the runtime's placement actually provides egress — from the selected
  subnets, not a guessed role — and validates `requiresEgress` against that. When
  egress can't be determined (e.g. an imported VPC whose subnets aren't known at
  synth) it warns rather than fabricating a pass/fail. `bb-distributed-data` (DSQL)
  now declares `requiresEgress: true`.
  
  **SSM interface endpoint is no longer always provisioned.** Only `AppSetting` and
  the auth blocks (which compose `AppSetting`) use SSM, so it now flows from Building
  Block requirements. An app that uses neither no longer pays for an unused interface
  endpoint. CloudWatch Logs stays always-on (every in-VPC Lambda needs it for log
  delivery).
  
  **The S3 gateway endpoint is now always provisioned.** The runtime pulls config,
  secrets, and migrations from S3 at cold start. Gateway endpoints are free
  (route-table entries, no ENI), so this closes a real cold-start access gap at no
  cost.

## 0.1.8

### Patch Changes

- c45eb92: Extend stack-wide `BlocksDefaults` (introduced in the Infrastructure Options work) with three additive fields, and adopt them across the Blocks-managed infrastructure. Each field is read independently via `option ?? scope.defaults.field` — a per-block option always wins, and no field is derived from another.
  
  `@aws-blocks/core/cdk` now adds to `BlocksDefaults` (and both `BlocksPresets`):
  
  - `logRetention: RetentionDays` — how long Blocks-managed CloudWatch log groups keep events. Preset sandbox `ONE_WEEK`, production `ONE_YEAR`.
  - `throttling: { rateLimit, burstLimit }` — request-rate limits applied to every Blocks API Gateway stage. Preset sandbox `200 / 400`, production `1000 / 2000`.
  - `accessLogging: boolean` — structured JSON access logs on every Blocks API Gateway stage. **Off by default in both presets** (opt-in), because enabling it mutates the account/region-level API Gateway CloudWatch role singleton.
  
  Also newly exported from `@aws-blocks/core/cdk`: the `BlocksThrottling` type and `ensureApiGatewayAccount()` (provisions the account-level API Gateway CloudWatch Logs role once per stack). `Scope` gains a `handlerLogGroup` getter for the shared handler log group.
  
  **Log retention** — Blocks-managed log groups now follow `defaults.logRetention` instead of AWS's infinite default: the shared handler Lambda (now owned by `BlocksStack`/`BlocksBackend` as `scope.handlerLogGroup`), the `bb-distributed-table` GSI-manager Lambdas, the `bb-distributed-data` DSQL migration Lambda, the `bb-data` Aurora migration Lambda, and the `bb-app-setting` secret-init Lambda. `bb-logger` reconfigures the shared handler group's retention — **only when an explicit per-Logger `retention` is set** (a bare `Logger` no longer writes it back, so it can't clobber another Logger's value) — rather than creating its own `/aws/lambda/<fn>` group. (Note: the framework `custom-resources.Provider` Lambdas these BBs wrap still use AWS's default retention — the L2 `Provider` exposes no log-group/retention override.)
  
  **Throttling** — applied to the core REST API stage and the `bb-realtime` WebSocket stage. On a WebSocket stage the throttle unit is messages/second across the connection.
  
  **Access logging** — when enabled, each stage writes structured JSON access logs to a dedicated CloudWatch log group (retention = `defaults.logRetention`, removal policy = `defaults.removalPolicy` so production **RETAIN**s the audit trail on teardown). The account-level API Gateway CloudWatch Logs role is provisioned once per stack and shared across stages.
  
  **⚠️ Behavior changes on upgrade:**
  - **Throttling now caps the core REST API and WebSocket stages.** Before this change these stages had no stage-level throttle (they ran at the API Gateway account default, ~10k rps). After upgrade, sandbox is capped at 200 rps / 400 burst and production at 1000 rps / 2000 burst. Apps serving above the production ceiling will see `429`s — raise it with a per-stack `throttling` override (`defaults: { ...BlocksPresets.production, throttling: { rateLimit, burstLimit } }`).
  - **The shared handler Lambda log group changes.** The handler previously logged to Lambda's auto-created `/aws/lambda/<fn>` group (infinite retention); it now logs to a framework-owned group with the default retention. On upgrade the old auto group is left orphaned in CloudWatch (unmanaged, still infinite) — delete it manually if you want its history/cost gone. Likewise a `bb-logger`-created retention group from a prior version is replaced.
  - **Access logging** is **opt-in (off in both presets)**. When enabled it requires the account-level API Gateway CloudWatch Logs role — an account/region-level singleton, so enabling it is safe for **one Blocks stack per region** (see `ensureApiGatewayAccount()` for the multi-stack teardown caveat). It defaults off (rather than on for production) so an upgrade never mutates that account-wide singleton without an explicit opt-in.
  - **`BlocksDefaults` gains three required fields** (`logRetention`, `throttling`, `accessLogging`). Apps that spread a `BlocksPresets` preset (the documented path) are unaffected; code that hand-rolls a literal `BlocksDefaults` object will need to add the new fields to compile.
  
  `bb-dashboard` now points its log widgets at the framework-owned handler log
  group (`scope.handlerLogGroup.logGroupName`) instead of reconstructing
  `/aws/lambda/<fn>` — the handler now writes to a dedicated group with a
  CDK-generated name, so the old convention would leave the "Recent Errors" /
  "Log Volume" widgets querying an empty group.
  
  Hosting adoption of these defaults (SSR REST API + compute log groups) ships in a separate change.

### Patch Changes

- 309a236: refactor(bb): attach IAM grants to the shared execution role
  
  Data and auth blocks now grant permissions to the shared Blocks execution role
  (`this.executionRole`) instead of the handler function directly. Grants land on
  the same role the handler assumes, so the effective runtime permissions are
  identical — this decouples IAM wiring from the concrete Lambda function ahead of
  the multi-compute model.
  
  For `bb-distributed-data`, the DSQL endpoint and region now flow through the
  config registry (loaded into `process.env` at cold start, like every other
  block) rather than being set as direct handler environment variables, and the
  migration Lambda maps the shared execution role's ARN.

### Patch Changes

- 7b4c62d: Add infrastructure `defaults` chosen once at the app entry point, replacing the per-block `sandboxMode` logic and the `RemovalPolicies`/`SandboxDisableDeletionProtection` mixin dance for removal-policy and deletion-protection.
  
  `@aws-blocks/core/cdk` now exports `BlocksDefaults` and the `BlocksPresets.sandbox` / `BlocksPresets.production` starting points. `BlocksStack.create` / `BlocksBackend.create` take a required `defaults` prop; start from a preset and override individual fields with a spread. `defaults` is anchored on the owning `BlocksStack`/`BlocksBackend` (resolved by walking up the construct tree, like `handler`/`executionRole`), so multiple backends in one stack each keep their own posture. Building Blocks read the resolved values via `scope.defaults`, and a per-block option always wins (`option ?? scope.defaults.field`).
  
  Adopted across the stateful Building Blocks: `bb-kv-store`, `bb-data`, `bb-distributed-data`, `bb-distributed-table`, and `bb-knowledge-base` now take their removal policy and deletion protection from `defaults` instead of reading the `sandboxMode` context themselves. (`bb-distributed-table` reads `defaults` directly for now; a richer per-block `protection` override lands with #282.)
  
  The `create-blocks-app` scaffolding templates are updated to pass `defaults: sandboxMode ? BlocksPresets.sandbox : BlocksPresets.production` (replacing the `RemovalPolicies`/`SandboxDisableDeletionProtection` mixin), so newly-generated apps satisfy the required prop.
  
  **Breaking:** `BlocksStack.create` / `BlocksBackend.create` now require a `defaults` field — pass `BlocksPresets.sandbox` or `BlocksPresets.production` (typically `sandboxMode ? BlocksPresets.sandbox : BlocksPresets.production`). The previously-shipped experimental `hardening` prop and its `resolve*` helpers are removed; log-retention, API throttling, access-logging and point-in-time-recovery move into `defaults` in follow-up, per-feature changes.
- 6df9e2d: fix(data): declare the `data-common` TypeScript project reference in `bb-data` and `bb-distributed-data`
  
  Both packages depend on `@aws-blocks/data-common` in `package.json`, but neither
  listed it in its `tsconfig.json` `references`. Because `src/` ships in these
  tarballs, `data-common`'s declarations have to already exist for the compiler to
  resolve `@aws-blocks/data-common` — and nothing in the project-reference graph
  guaranteed that.
  
  Correct build order was therefore supplied by the position of `data-common` in
  the root `workspaces` array (index 8, ahead of `bb-data` at 10 and
  `bb-distributed-data` at 11) rather than by the dependency graph. Any build that
  does not follow that array order fails with:
  
  ```
  packages/bb-distributed-data/src/validation.ts(12,54): error TS2307:
    Cannot find module '@aws-blocks/data-common' or its corresponding type declarations.
  ```
  
  That was already reachable from the repo's own scripts: the former
  `npm run build:packages` resolved its `-w` targets in a different order and hit
  exactly this, which is why `scripts/agent-bench/steps/1-init-bench-app.sh`
  carried the comment "`build:packages` runs alphabetically and trips over
  bb-data". Adding the two missing references fixes the root cause, so build order
  now comes from the project-reference graph rather than from the ordering of the
  root `workspaces` array.
  
  No API, runtime, or packaged-output change — `tsconfig.json` is not in either
  package's `files`, so the published tarballs are unchanged.
- 3614a09: Bundle the migration lambdas through `blocksNodejsBundling()` so `import.meta.url` used anywhere in the bundled migration handler is shimmed to its CommonJS equivalent instead of throwing at Lambda load. Consistent with the backend handler; no behavior change for existing migration lambdas. Also documents in the README that `migrationsPath` is simplest as a path relative to your project root, and that `import.meta.url` inside the bundle resolves to the bundled output (not your source tree).
- e4b1498: Retry PGlite's WASM initialization on the intermittent `_pg_initdb` `unreachable` trap.
  
  PGlite defers `initdb` to the first query, which can trap with `unreachable` under memory pressure (notably on CI when several PGlite-backed dev servers boot concurrently) and kill the dev server mid-`runMigrations`. `PGliteEngine` (bb-data) and `DsqlMockEngine` (bb-distributed-data) now force initialization through a shared bounded retry (`initializePgliteWithRetry` in data-common) that closes the aborted WASM instance and boots a fresh one, so a transient init trap recovers instead of crashing the process.

### Patch Changes

- a584007: fix(data-common): defer getEngine() in createKyselyAdapter so adapters are safe at module scope

  `createKyselyAdapter()` eagerly called `db.getEngine()` at construction. Backend
  `index.ts` is also loaded during `cdk synth`, where the infra-only (cdk) builds of
  `DistributedDatabase` / `Database` expose no engine — so creating the adapter at
  module scope crashed synth with `db.getEngine is not a function`.

  - **data-common** — the adapter now passes a thunk (`() => db.getEngine()`) into
    the Kysely dialect and resolves the engine lazily on the first query (still
    memoized per connection, preserving the one-engine-per-transaction guarantee
    the handle-based transaction API relies on). Adapter creation is now
    side-effect free and safe at module scope. Public API and runtime behavior are
    unchanged.
  - **bb-distributed-data / bb-data** — the cdk builds gain a `getEngine()` that
    throws a clear, actionable message if a query is ever reached during synth,
    replacing the cryptic "is not a function".

- 0491157: `Metrics`, `Tracer`, and `DistributedDatabase` now report `bbName`/`bbVersion` to `Scope`, so they appear in telemetry like every other Building Block.

  All three were listed in the umbrella's `aws-blocks.vendorize` map, so `scripts/generate-bb-names.mjs` had already generated them into `OFFICIAL_BB_NAMES` — but none passed `bbMeta` to `super()`, and `Scope` only records a block in its registry when `bbName` is set. Their entries in that set were therefore inert: `Scope.getRegisteredBlocks()` could never name them, so `product.buildingBlocks` under-reported them. Each package now carries the standard `prebuild` (`generate-version.mjs Metrics` / `Tracer` / `DistributedDatabase`), which generates the `BB_NAME`/`BB_VERSION` its constructor passes through — the same wiring the other blocks use.

  `bb-tracer` and `bb-distributed-data` ship distinct mock implementations (their default entry does not re-export the AWS class), so both `index.aws.ts` and `index.mock.ts` carry the change; `bb-metrics`'s mock re-exports the AWS class, so its single runtime change covers both conditions. CDK entry points are deliberately left alone — telemetry is reported by the runtime class, not the synth-time construct.

  This is a follow-up to #298 (`AuthBasic`/`Logger`), completing telemetry parity for every vendorized block whose runtime class extends `Scope`. `@aws-blocks/blocks` takes a `patch` because it re-exports all three; sibling releases stay inside its caret range, so `changeset version` would not bump it on its own. `@aws-blocks/core` needs no bump — all three names were already present in the generated `OFFICIAL_BB_NAMES`, so that file is byte-identical.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 0f3c73c: Reject `ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN` at dev time, including the keyword-less Postgres shorthand (`ALTER TABLE t DROP col` / `DROP IF EXISTS col`). It is not in DSQL's supported `ALTER TABLE` subset ("unsupported ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN statement", 0A000), but the PGlite-based local mock previously accepted it, so the error only surfaced on deploy. Migration and mock validation now fail locally instead. The supported forms — `ALTER COLUMN ... DROP DEFAULT` / `DROP NOT NULL` / `DROP EXPRESSION` / `DROP IDENTITY` and `DROP CONSTRAINT` — are not affected.

  The `@aws-blocks/blocks` umbrella package receives a `patch` because its published `docs/` folder is assembled from sibling block READMEs at build time (`scripts/sync-block-docs.mjs`), so this `bb-distributed-data` README update changes `@aws-blocks/blocks` packaged content.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- c7f1e7c: Reject index key sort direction (`ASC`/`DESC`) in `CREATE INDEX` at dev time. DSQL does not allow a sort direction on index keys ("specifying sort order not supported for index keys"), but the PGlite-based local mock previously accepted it, so the error only surfaced on deploy. Migration and mock validation now fail locally instead. (`NULLS FIRST/LAST` is supported by DSQL and is not rejected.)

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- ba3bf7b: docs: add per-package DESIGN.md documents

  Adds a `DESIGN.md` to each building-block package describing its architecture, API surface, mock implementation, and key design decisions.

  - Each document is cross-checked against the current source so identifiers, environment variables, error names, and described behavior match the implementation.
  - Each `DESIGN.md` is listed in its package's `files` array so it ships on npm alongside `README.md`.
  - For consistency, `bb-auth-cognito`'s document lives at the package root like every other package.
  - Bumps the umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` package so its bundled `docs/` — assembled from these block READMEs at build time — republishes with a fresh version. Its packed content changes whenever the READMEs change, but the version was previously left untouched, which tripped the publish integrity guard.
