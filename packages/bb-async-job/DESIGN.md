# AsyncJob — Design

Design document for AsyncJob. For usage, examples, and best practices, see [README.md](./README.md).

**Package:** `@aws-blocks/bb-async-job`
**Type:** Primitive (new infrastructure)
**AWS Services:** Amazon SQS + shared Lambda

## Overview

AsyncJob provides background job processing: submit a payload, get a job ID back, and a handler processes it asynchronously with automatic retries and dead-letter handling. It targets fire-and-forget work offloaded from the request path — sending emails, processing uploads, generating reports, fan-out tasks.

**Key distinction from CronJob:** AsyncJob is the programmable runtime primitive — it exposes `submit()` and `submitBatch()`, and work is triggered when application code enqueues a payload. CronJob is a pure infrastructure declaration with no runtime methods, triggered by an EventBridge schedule. Both target the shared Lambda.

## Architecture

```
Application code
    └── submit(payload) / submitBatch(payloads)
         └── SQS queue (one per AsyncJob instance)
              └── SqsEventSource → shared Lambda
                   └── routes record by queue name → registered handler
                        └── handler(payload, context)

Status (only when trackStatus: true)
    └── nested DistributedTable (partition key jobId, TTL expiresAt)
         └── queued on submit, processing per delivery, complete/failed on settle
              └── getStatus(jobId) / waitUntilComplete(jobId)

Retry / failure
    └── SQS redrive: maxReceiveCount = maxRetries → dead-letter queue (DLQ)

Local Mock
    └── AsyncJob class (extends Scope)
         └── in-process queue (setTimeout) with retry + DLQ bookkeeping
              └── _queue: { pending, processing, delayed, failed, totals }
```

## Design Decisions

### D-AJ-1: SQS standard queue with a dedicated DLQ

**Decision:** Each AsyncJob creates its own SQS standard queue plus a dedicated dead-letter queue. The main queue's redrive policy sets `maxReceiveCount` to `maxRetries` (default 3); exhausted messages move to the DLQ (14-day retention).

**Rationale:** A per-job DLQ isolates poison messages so a single failing job type can't bury unrelated work. Standard (not FIFO) queues give nearly unlimited throughput and at-least-once delivery, which matches the idempotent-handler contract. The 14-day DLQ retention is the SQS maximum, giving operators time to inspect and redrive failures.

### D-AJ-1a: Visibility timeout covers the batching window as well as the handler

**Decision:** The main queue's visibility timeout is `900 + maxBatchingWindowSeconds` seconds, not a flat 900 s.

**Rationale:** A message becomes invisible when the poller *receives* it, which happens before the batching window elapses and before the handler is invoked. Worst-case time-to-completion for a message is therefore `maxBatchingWindowSeconds + handler runtime`, and the handler runtime is bounded by the shared Lambda's 900 s timeout. A flat 900 s timeout lets SQS make a message visible again while its invocation is still running (905 s worst case at the default 5 s window, and up to 1200 s at the 300 s maximum), redelivering work that was never lost. Sizing the timeout as window + Lambda timeout is the deterministic minimum: the longest a message can legitimately be in flight, since Lambda's platform timeout caps handler runtime regardless of `batchSize`. The Lambda timeout is imported from core (`SHARED_HANDLER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`) rather than re-hardcoded, so the two cannot drift.

**Not AWS's recommended value.** AWS recommends `6 x functionTimeout + maxBatchingWindow`, where the 6x buffers *invoke-side throttling retries*: if the function is at its concurrency ceiling, the poller retries the invoke while the message stays invisible, and the message can go visible again before the handler has ever run. That is reachable here, because the target Lambda is shared with API and CronJob traffic (D-AJ-2). We take the 1x minimum deliberately: at the 900 s shared timeout, 6x would be a 5400–5700 s visibility timeout, so a genuinely stuck message would take ~1.5 h per attempt to become visible again and ~4.5 h to reach the DLQ at the default `maxRetries` of 3 — trading a rare duplicate delivery for an operationally useless retry loop. The residual exposure is redundant work, not loss: delivery is at-least-once and handlers must be idempotent regardless (see below), and `receiveCount` in the handler context lets a handler detect a redelivery. Consumers that would rather pay the latency can raise the ceiling by keeping handler runtimes well under 900 s.

**Handler contract:** at-least-once delivery still applies — this removes a redelivery the block itself would have caused, it does not make handlers exempt from being idempotent. A whole-invocation failure (Lambda timeout or OOM) redelivers every message in the batch, including records whose handler already completed; see the README's batching notes.

### D-AJ-2: Shared Lambda target (not a dedicated per-job Lambda)

**Decision:** The queue's `SqsEventSource` targets the shared API Lambda — the same function used by API handlers and CronJob — rather than a dedicated function per job.

**Rationale:** One Lambda handles all routes, async jobs, and cron jobs, so handlers can compose other Building Blocks (KVStore, FileBucket, etc.) with permissions already granted, and there are no per-job cold starts or idle cost. The trade-off is shared timeout (900 s) and memory across all job types.

### D-AJ-3: Visibility timeout pinned to the Lambda timeout

**Decision:** The main queue's visibility timeout is set to 900 seconds — equal to the shared Lambda's maximum timeout.

**Rationale:** SQS requires the visibility timeout to be at least as long as the consumer's processing time; otherwise a still-running message becomes visible again and is processed twice. Pinning it to the Lambda's 900 s ceiling guarantees a message is never redelivered while its handler is still running.

### D-AJ-4: Client-side validation before enqueue

**Decision:** `submit()`/`submitBatch()` validate the schema (when configured) and the 256 KB payload size before calling SQS. `submitBatch` rejects an empty batch first, then validates *every* payload before enqueuing any of them.

**Rationale:** Failing fast on the caller's side produces a precise typed error (`PayloadTooLarge`, `ValidationFailed`, `BatchEmpty`) instead of a generic SQS rejection, and avoids a network round-trip for input that cannot succeed. Validating the whole batch up front means one bad payload fails the call without half-submitting the batch. The mock applies identical checks so violations surface the same `error.name` in local dev.

### D-AJ-4a: `submitBatch` auto-chunks; a multi-chunk submit is not atomic

**Decision:** `submitBatch` accepts up to {@link MAX_BATCH_PAYLOADS} (10,000) payloads. It packs them into `SendMessageBatch` requests bounded by both SQS per-request limits — at most 10 entries and at most 256 KB of aggregate message body — and sends those requests with bounded concurrency (at most {@link MAX_BATCH_CONCURRENCY} = 5 in flight). Each batch entry's `Id` is the payload's original index, so returned `MessageId`s (and failures) map straight back into input order. The original 10-item hard cap is replaced by this much higher soft cap: over the limit throws `BatchTooLarge` before any send, a guardrail against a single call fanning out to an unbounded number of SQS requests.

**Rationale:** A bulk-upload caller with more than 10 items should not have to reimplement SQS's chunking rules. Splitting by both the count and the byte limit is necessary because either can be the binding constraint — ten 30 KB messages exceed 256 KB, and a single message is already capped at 256 KB by `validatePayload` so it always fits in a chunk of its own. Sending chunks serially would turn a 1,000-payload batch into 100 sequential round trips, so chunks overlap up to a fixed in-flight limit; the limit keeps the SQS client's concurrency predictable and bounds the blast radius when the endpoint is unhealthy.

**Trade-off — not atomic across chunks.** A single `SendMessageBatch` is one request, but a batch spanning several chunks is several requests, and an earlier chunk can land before a later one fails. `submitBatch` keeps the all-or-nothing *signal* — it throws `BatchSubmitFailed` if any entry in any chunk failed — but the thrown error carries the partial reality: `.jobIds` holds the real `MessageId` for every entry that made it onto the queue (with `null` at each failed index), and `.failed[]` lists every failure across all chunks sorted by index. A caller that catches it can retry only the `null` indexes rather than re-submitting the whole batch and double-enqueuing the ones that succeeded.

Two distinct failure kinds feed `.failed[]`. An *entry-level* failure (SQS accepts the request, rejects a message) carries that message's `Code`/`Message` and is scoped to its index. A *transport-level* failure — the `send()` promise itself rejects (throttling, connection, auth) — cannot be attributed to individual entries, so every index in that chunk is marked failed with the error's `name`, and the chunks not yet started are short-circuited (`code: 'BatchSubmitAborted'`) rather than hammering an endpoint that just failed; chunks already in flight settle normally. A defensive pass also converts any index SQS returns in *neither* list into a `MissingResult` failure, so a `null` id never escapes as a "success".

**Status writes are best-effort, not part of the contract.** On full success the `queued` fan-out (`trackStatus: true`) runs *after* every message is enqueued and is wrapped so a failure there (e.g. DynamoDB throttling on a large batch) is logged, not thrown — otherwise a bookkeeping error would make the caller treat a fully-successful enqueue as a failure and re-submit, double-enqueuing everything. The handler backfills a `queued` record when it first sees a job, so the record is not lost. On the partial-failure (throw) path no status is written at all; the same backfill covers the enqueued jobs. The mock runtime submits one message at a time and never partially fails, so the transport/abort paths are an AWS-only concern.

### D-AJ-5: Event routing via queue name

**Decision:** In AWS, the handler is registered with `registerLambdaEventHandler(EventSourceMapping.SQS, queueName, ...)`. The shared Lambda routes an incoming SQS record to the matching AsyncJob by the queue name parsed from the queue URL. The queue URL is injected via the `BLOCKS_QUEUE_URL_{FULLID}` environment variable.

**Rationale:** Routing by queue name keeps dispatch consistent with the rest of the framework (CronJob routes by `source` + `jobName`) and needs no extra infrastructure. When the env var is absent (e.g. during codegen, not a real Lambda invocation), handler registration is skipped so synthesis does not fail.

### D-AJ-6: Browser stub is a no-op

**Decision:** The `index.browser.ts` entry point exports an `AsyncJob` whose constructor does nothing, re-exports the shared `AsyncJobErrors` map, and re-exports the package's types.

**Rationale:** AsyncJob enqueues to SQS (AWS runtime) or runs an in-process queue (mock, Node). Neither is available in the browser. A no-op stub keeps the package importable in isomorphic bundles without pulling in the AWS SDK; job submission only happens server-side (server actions, API routes, Lambda handlers). Types and error constants are erased or inert, so re-exporting them costs nothing at runtime and lets isomorphic code type against `AsyncJobStatus` without importing the server entry point.

### D-AJ-7: Job status is an append-only transition history, opt-in per job

**Decision:** `trackStatus: true` provisions a nested `DistributedTable` (partition key `jobId`, TTL attribute `expiresAt`, 24-hour retention) and records a job's lifecycle into it: `queued` on submit, `processing` at the start of every delivery, and `complete` or `failed` once it settles. Transitions are **appended** to a `transitions` array rather than overwriting a single state field. Two runtime methods read it: `getStatus(jobId)` and `waitUntilComplete(jobId, options?)`. Without the flag nothing is provisioned and both methods throw `StatusNotTrackedException`.

**Rationale:** The state a caller most wants to see is `processing`, and it is the one hardest to catch — a handler that finishes in a millisecond passes through it faster than any client can poll. Storing the current state alone therefore makes observation a race, which callers were previously forced to win by padding their handler with an artificial delay. An append-only history removes the race outright: a reader that polls once, after the job settled, still sees that it passed through `processing`, so no timing assumption is needed anywhere. A retry appends another `processing` entry instead of a second terminal state, which also makes attempt counts legible.

Read-modify-write on the array is safe because SQS keeps a message invisible while its handler runs, so only one attempt writes a given job's record at a time.

Tracking is opt-in because it is not free: it adds a DynamoDB table per job plus a write on submit and one per transition, and `submitBatch` would turn a single native SQS batch into an extra batch write. AsyncJob's default remains a single SQS call, and existing deployments gain no resources until they ask for them. `DistributedTable` rather than `KVStore` because only the former supports TTL, so status records expire on their own instead of accumulating.

**Compute identity boundary:** status transitions are framework bookkeeping, not
application records. The private nested status table is marked for system access
so queued/processing/complete/failed writes continue to work without serializing
request credentials into SQS. The job payload carries no credentials, and a job
handler that accesses identity-protected application data runs without an active
identity and fails closed.

**Failure handling:** the `queued` write propagates to the caller — `submit()` asked for tracking, so failing loudly before the job is observable is correct. Writes on the handler path are swallowed and logged instead: throwing before the handler would retry work that was fine, and throwing after it succeeded would re-run work that had already completed. Status bookkeeping must never decide a job's fate. The visible consequence is that a dropped terminal write leaves a finished job without a terminal state, so `waitUntilComplete()` reports `Timeout` for work that actually succeeded — callers are told to read `Timeout` as "status unknown" rather than "still running", and to consult the job's own effect when they need certainty.

**Not chosen:** publishing transitions over `bb-realtime`. Push delivery does not solve the underlying problem — a subscriber that connects after the fact still misses the event — and it would add a WebSocket dependency to every AsyncJob. Recorded history is both smaller and strictly more useful, since it works for late readers, retries, and tests alike.

### D-AJ-8: Status writes use optimistic concurrency, not bare last-write-wins

**Decision:** Appending a transition is a read-modify-write, guarded by a compare-and-swap on a `version` counter: the follow-up `put` is conditional on `ifFieldEquals: { version }` (or `ifNotExists` when creating), and a lost swap re-reads and re-applies, up to 5 attempts. `recordQueued` is likewise conditional on `ifNotExists`, and treats a lost race as success. Both `version` and the TTL attribute `expiresAt` are stripped from the record `getStatus()` returns.

**Rationale:** two writers can hold the same job's record at once, in two distinct ways.

The likely one is submit versus delivery. In AWS the job id *is* the SQS message id, so the `queued` write cannot happen until `SendMessage` has returned — by which point SQS may already have delivered the message and the handler may already have created the record by backfilling `queued`. An unconditional `queued` write would then overwrite the `processing` entry and reset the state, stranding a running job at `queued` permanently.

The rarer one is duplicate delivery. Standard queues are at-least-once, and this block's own README already instructs handlers to expect more than one delivery, so two invocations can append concurrently. `batchSize` is *not* a factor: a batch carries distinct messages, hence distinct message ids and distinct partition keys, and SQS never returns the same message twice in one receive.

Neither case can corrupt an item — DynamoDB `PutItem` is atomic per item — but plain last-write-wins would silently drop a transition, and dropping the terminal one converts a successful job into a `waitUntilComplete()` timeout. A version check is far cheaper than the alternative of modelling each transition as its own row with a sort key, which would double the read cost of `getStatus()` for a history that is only ever a handful of entries.

`recordQueuedBatch` issues individual conditional writes rather than one `putBatch`, because DynamoDB's `BatchWriteItem` cannot carry a condition expression and would reintroduce the clobber. Since `submitBatch` auto-chunks (D-AJ-4a) a batch is no longer capped at 10, so the writes are issued in fixed-size groups (`STATUS_WRITE_GROUP` = 25, mirroring DynamoDB's `BatchWriteItem` limit) rather than one unbounded `Promise.all` — firing thousands of conditional `PutItem`s at once would risk throttling the table on exactly the bulk write this is meant to support.

## Infrastructure (CDK)

Creates the following resources per AsyncJob instance:

1. **SQS Dead-Letter Queue** — name `{fullId}-dlq` (truncated to 80 chars), 14-day retention, `SQS_MANAGED` encryption, `enforceSSL`.
2. **SQS Main Queue** — name `{fullId}` (truncated to 80 chars), visibility timeout `900 + maxBatchingWindowSeconds` s (see D-AJ-1a), redrive to the DLQ with `maxReceiveCount = maxRetries`, `SQS_MANAGED` encryption, `enforceSSL`.
3. **Event Source Mapping** — `SqsEventSource(queue, { batchSize, reportBatchItemFailures: true, maxBatchingWindow })` wired to the shared handler. `batchSize` comes from `options.batchSize` (default 10) and `maxBatchingWindow` from `options.maxBatchingWindowSeconds` (default 5 s, range 0–300). Partial-batch reporting is **always on and not configurable**, because it is required for any `batchSize > 1`. Without `ReportBatchItemFailures` in the mapping's `FunctionResponseTypes`, a single failing record makes SQS treat the entire batch as handled and delete every message in it — silent data loss. The runtime handler always returns `{ batchItemFailures }` to match. Both options are range-checked in the constructor and rejected at synth time with `InvalidOptionException`: `batchSize` must be 1–10 with no batching window, or 1–10000 once `maxBatchingWindowSeconds > 0`. Those are the limits AWS itself enforces when it creates the mapping, so the check only moves the failure from mid-deployment to synth.
4. **Status table** (only when `trackStatus: true`) — a nested `DistributedTable` at child id `status`, partition key `jobId`, TTL attribute `expiresAt`. Provisioned with the same child id and options as the runtime entry points so the table the runtime resolves is the one CDK created.

**IAM grants to handler:** `grantSendMessages` on the main queue (so handlers can enqueue further work).
**Environment variables injected:** `BLOCKS_QUEUE_URL_{FULLID}` (uppercased `fullId`, non-alphanumerics replaced with `_`) → the main queue URL, registered via `registerConfig`.

No `fromExisting()` — wrapping a pre-existing SQS queue is not supported. AsyncJob owns the queue lifecycle.

## AWS Runtime

- Reads the queue URL from `BLOCKS_QUEUE_URL_{FULLID}`; registers the SQS handler only when the URL is present.
- `submit()` sends a single `SendMessageCommand`; returns `{ jobId: MessageId }`.
- `submitBatch()` packs the payloads into as many `SendMessageBatchCommand` requests as SQS's per-request limits require — at most 10 entries and at most 256 KB of aggregate body per request — issuing one command per chunk (see D-AJ-4a). Each entry's `Id` is the payload's original index, so successful entries map back to `jobIds` by index and failed entries populate `failed`. If any entry in any chunk fails, it throws `BatchSubmitFailedException` carrying `failed` and `jobIds` (real MessageIds for enqueued entries, `null` at failed indexes) for partial-result handling; a multi-chunk submit is not atomic, so earlier chunks may already be on the queue (see D-AJ-4a).
- Each delivered record is parsed into `{ payload, context }` where `context = { jobId: messageId, receiveCount: ApproximateReceiveCount, sentAt: SentTimestamp }`.
- SQS redrive handles retries; after `maxReceiveCount` deliveries the message lands in the DLQ.
- When `trackStatus` is enabled, `submit()` records `queued` after the send (the job id *is* the SQS message id, so it is not known before), `submitBatch()` records the batch via `recordQueuedBatch` — individual conditional writes, one per job, not a `putBatch` (see D-AJ-8), and only on full success (on a throw the enqueued jobs are still tracked because `_processRecord` backfills their `queued` record) — and `_processRecord` records `processing` before the handler and `complete` after it. A handler error only records `failed` once `receiveCount` has reached `maxRetries` — SQS owns the retry decision, so earlier failures record nothing and the next delivery simply appends another `processing` entry.

## Mock Implementation

- An in-process queue drives processing via `setTimeout(…, 0)`; `delaySeconds` is honored with a deferred timer.
- Job IDs are a 13-character slice of `randomUUID()`.
- Retry semantics mirror AWS: on handler error the entry is retried until `receiveCount >= maxRetries`, then moved to an in-memory `failed` (DLQ) list with `failedAt` and `lastError` recorded.
- Queue state is exposed on `_queue` (`pending`, `processing`, `delayed`, `failed`, `totalSubmitted`, `totalCompleted`) for dev-server inspection.
- Identical schema and 256 KB payload-size validation runs before enqueue, producing the same typed errors as AWS.
- When `trackStatus` is enabled, the same `JobStatusTracker` runs as in AWS — it composes a `DistributedTable`, whose own conditional exports resolve to the mock (JSON on disk under `.bb-data/`) locally and to DynamoDB in AWS, so there is one status code path rather than two. `submit()` records `queued` before scheduling the entry, and `processEntry` records `processing` per attempt and `complete`/`failed` on settle.
- Console logs trace submission, completion (with duration), retries, and DLQ moves, prefixed `[AsyncJob:{id}]`.

### Mock vs AWS Behavior Differences

| Behavior Difference | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|--------|------------|
| In-process queue (not SQS) | Jobs run in the dev server process; nothing persists across restarts | No mitigation — local queue is for development flow. Sandbox testing exercises real SQS |
| Handler runs in-process (not isolated) | Shared memory, no cold start, no per-job timeout enforcement | No mitigation — the shared Lambda in AWS is also not isolated per-job |
| No real visibility timeout | Retries are immediate rather than after a timeout window | No mitigation — timing differences don't affect at-least-once + retry correctness |
| `submitBatch()` never returns partial failures | The mock enqueues each payload locally, so `failed` is always empty and `BatchSubmitFailed` is never thrown | AWS surfaces per-entry failures; design handlers and callers to handle the `failed` array and `BatchSubmitFailedException` |
| Status records never expire locally | The mock `DistributedTable` has no TTL sweeper, so status records persist in `.bb-data/` until it is cleared, whereas DynamoDB deletes them ~24 hours after the last transition | No mitigation needed — local records are small and `.bb-data/` is disposable. Do not rely on a record being *absent* after 24 hours in either runtime; DynamoDB TTL deletion is asynchronous and best-effort |
| Concurrent status writes never actually collide locally | The mock queue delivers each job once to a single in-process consumer, so the compare-and-swap in D-AJ-8 never has to retry and a dropped terminal write cannot happen. In AWS at-least-once delivery makes both reachable | The CAS is exercised directly against the tracker in unit tests rather than through the mock queue. Callers must read `waitUntilComplete()`'s `Timeout` as "status unknown" rather than "still running", since only the deployed runtime can drop a terminal write |
| No IAM enforcement | Permission errors only surface in AWS | No mitigation — IAM is handled by CDK grants automatically |

## Integration with CronJob

AsyncJob and CronJob are complementary primitives:

| Aspect | AsyncJob | CronJob |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Trigger** | Event-based (code calls `.submit()`) | Time-based (EventBridge schedule) |
| **Runtime methods** | `.submit()`, `.submitBatch()`, `.getStatus()`, `.waitUntilComplete()` | None (infrastructure-only) |
| **AWS service** | SQS | EventBridge Scheduler |
| **Delivery guarantee** | At-least-once (SQS) | At-least-once (EventBridge) |
| **Retry mechanism** | SQS redrive + DLQ | Lambda async invoke retry |
| **Payload** | Dynamic per `.submit()` call | Static `input` set at deploy time |
| **Lambda target** | Shared Lambda (same as CronJob) | Shared Lambda (same as AsyncJob) |

Common pattern: a CronJob triggers periodic work that uses an AsyncJob for fan-out:

```typescript
const processor = new AsyncJob<{ itemId: string }>(scope, 'processor', {
  handler: async (payload) => { /* process one item */ },
});

new CronJob(scope, 'daily-batch', {
  schedule: 'cron(0 2 * * ? *)',
  handler: async () => {
    const items = await db.query({ stale: true });
    await processor.submitBatch(items.map((i) => ({ itemId: i.id })));
  },
});
```
