 * before it imports the backend module that constructs any `ApiNamespace`, so

 * here it would signal a genuine lifecycle violation (an `ApiNamespace` built
 * before `create()` resolved), which should surface rather than be swallowed.

/**
 * Define a type-safe API namespace that works seamlessly between frontend and backend.
 * 
 * ## Usage
 * 
 * Define your API in the backend (`aws-blocks/index.ts`):
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * const scope = new Scope('my-app');
 * 
 * export const api = new ApiNamespace(scope, 'api', (context) => ({
 *   async greet(name: string) {
 *     return { message: `Hello, ${name}!` };
 *   },
 *   
 *   async deleteAccount(id: string) {
 *     // Gated: throws 401 if the caller has no valid session.
 *     await auth.requireAuth(context);
 *     return db.users.delete(id);
 *   }
 * }));
 * ```
 * 
 * Import and call from the frontend with full type safety:
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * import { api } from 'aws-blocks';
 * 
 * const result = await api.greet('World'); // Fully typed
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Authentication — every method is a public endpoint
 * 
 * Each method becomes a public, internet-reachable RPC endpoint with **no
 * authentication by default**. Gating is opt-in per method by calling an auth
 * Building Block at the top of the handler:
 * 
 * ```typescript
 * export const api = new ApiNamespace(scope, 'api', (context) => ({
 *   // No requireAuth call → callable by anyone.
 *   async listPublicPosts() {
 *     return db.posts.findPublished();
 *   },
 * 
 *   async createPost(input: NewPost) {
 *     const user = await auth.requireAuth(context);
 *     return db.posts.create({ ...input, authorId: user.userId });
 *   },
 * 
 *   async deletePost(id: string) {
 *     await auth.requireRole(context, 'admins');
 *     return db.posts.delete(id);
 *   },
 * }));
 * ```
 * 
 * The local mock applies no auth either, so an ungated method passes every
 * local check and still ships callable by anyone. See your auth block's README
 * (e.g. `@aws-blocks/bb-auth-cognito`) for `requireAuth` / `requireRole`.
 * 
 * ## Context
 * 
 * The `context` parameter provides access to:
 * - `context.request.headers` - Incoming request headers
 * - `context.request.json()` - Parse request body as JSON
 * - `context.response.headers` - Set response headers (e.g., cookies)
 * - `context.response.status` - Set HTTP status code
 * 
 * ## Local vs Deployed
 * 
 * - **Local**: APIs run in-process. Calls are direct function invocations.
 * - **Deployed**: APIs run in Lambda. Calls go through API Gateway over HTTPS.
 * 
 * The same code works in both environments without changes.
 * 
 * ## Scaling Characteristics (AWS)
 * 
 * - Serverless: Auto-scales from 0 to thousands of concurrent requests
 * - Cold starts: ~100-500ms for first request after idle period
 * - Warm requests: Single-digit millisecond overhead
 * - Cost: Pay per request (free tier: 1M requests/month)
 * 
 * ## Best Practices
 * 
 * - No auth by default — gate methods with `requireAuth`/`requireRole` (see above)
 * - Keep API methods focused and single-purpose
 * - Use async/await for all I/O operations
 * - Return serializable data (JSON-compatible types)
 * - Handle errors explicitly - they'll be sent to the client
 * - Use Building Blocks (KVStore, DistributedTable) for state
