# FileBucket — Design

Design document for FileBucket. For usage, see [README.md](./README.md).

**Package:** `@aws-blocks/bb-file-bucket`
**Type:** Primitive (new infrastructure)
**AWS Service:** Amazon S3

## Design Decisions

**D-FB-1: Buffer body type instead of ReadableStream**
**Decision:** `put()` accepts `Buffer | string`, `get()` returns `Buffer` in `FileContent.body`.
**Rationale:** ReadableStream adds complexity for the common case (small-to-medium files). Buffer is simpler to work with in Lambda (where the entire response must be buffered anyway). For large files, presigned URLs (`getUrl`/`putUrl`) are the recommended pattern. This favors client-safe return types.

**D-FB-2: Segregated internal storage in mock**
**Decision:** The mock stores user content, sidecar metadata, and version history under separate sibling roots inside `.bb-data/{fullId}/`:
```
content/{key}                     file body (byte-identical to what was written)
meta/{key}.json                   sidecar metadata
versions/{key}/{versionId}        version body
versions/{key}/{versionId}.json   version metadata
versions/{key}/__deleted__        delete marker (sentinel)
```
**Rationale:** Keeps file content byte-identical (no wrapping format) while guaranteeing internal bookkeeping can never collide with user keys. An earlier design co-located metadata as `{path}.__meta__.json` next to each file and relied on marker substrings, which meant a user key like `data.__meta__.json` or a directory named `x.__versions__/` could be silently hidden or shadowed by `scan()`. Because user content now lives only under `content/`, `scan()` walks that one root and yields everything with no marker-based filtering — arbitrary keys are supported, matching S3 semantics.

**D-FB-3: deleteBatch chunks at 1,000**
**Decision:** `deleteBatch()` internally chunks into groups of 1,000 and issues separate `DeleteObjects` calls.
**Rationale:** S3 `DeleteObjects` API supports max 1,000 keys per request. Chunking is transparent to the caller. Batch methods handle pagination internally.

**D-FB-4: Presigned URL default expiry of 3600 seconds**
**Decision:** Both `getUrl` and `putUrl` default to 1 hour expiry.
**Rationale:** Matches the S3 SDK default. Long enough for typical browser upload/download flows, short enough to limit exposure.

**D-FB-5: scan returns AsyncIterable**
**Decision:** `scan()` returns `AsyncIterable<FileInfo>` with internal pagination.
**Rationale:** AsyncIterable is used for unbounded result sets. S3 `ListObjectsV2` paginates at 1,000 keys; the iterable handles continuation tokens transparently.

**D-FB-6: Versioning is opt-in with runtime API support**
**Decision:** `versioned: true` enables S3 object versioning and unlocks version-aware methods (`listVersions`, `restoreVersion`, optional `versionId` on `get`/`delete`/`getUrl`/`getFileHandle`). Without the flag, the API surface is unchanged.
**Rationale:** Versioning adds storage cost and complexity. Making it opt-in keeps the default simple. When enabled, the runtime API exposes the full version lifecycle — listing, retrieving specific versions, permanent deletion of individual versions, and restoring old versions. `restoreVersion` is implemented as a CopyObject from the old version (S3 has no native restore), which creates a new version that becomes current.
**Update:** The **default flipped to ON** — see D-FB-10. The runtime API described here is unchanged; only the default value of `versioned` and its typing gate changed.

**D-FB-7: Mock versioning uses filesystem directories**
**Decision:** Versioned mock stores each version in `versions/{key}/v{n}` with monotonic IDs. Delete markers are `versions/{key}/__deleted__` sentinel files.
**Rationale:** Simple, inspectable, and matches the S3 semantics closely enough for local development. Monotonic IDs (`v1`, `v2`, ...) are deterministic and easy to reason about in tests, unlike S3's opaque version IDs. Version history lives under the segregated `versions/` root (see D-FB-2), so it never appears in `scan()` or collides with a user key.

**D-FB-8: Bucket name validated at synth — error, never truncate/hash**
**Decision:** The derived bucket name (`scope.fullId`) is validated against S3's naming rules (`bucket-name.ts`) before the bucket is constructed. An invalid name throws a `ValidationFailed` error with an actionable message. The same validator runs in the mock constructor so local dev (`bb dev`) fails identically — parity. `FileBucket.fromExisting(...)` skips validation since the name is externally owned.
**Rationale:** S3 bucket names are globally unique and immutable. Truncating to fit 63 chars risks collisions, and a name that shifts between deploys (e.g. after a hash input changes) would orphan or replace the customer's data — a far worse outcome than a fast, fixable synth error. Erroring puts the fix in the developer's hands (shorten a scope id once; the name is then stable forever) and matches the manual-shortening pattern already used in `bb-agent`. This deliberately differs from DynamoDB-backed BBs (KVStore/DistributedTable) which `substring(0, 255)` — DynamoDB's 255 limit is generous and table names are internal, disposable, and not globally unique, so silent truncation is acceptable there.

**D-FB-9: TLS enforced unconditionally (enforceSSL)**
**Decision:** Every provisioned bucket (the data bucket and the opt-in access-log bucket) sets `enforceSSL: true`, so CDK attaches a bucket policy denying any request where `aws:SecureTransport` is `false`. Not configurable.
**Rationale:** All FileBucket traffic — SDK calls and presigned URLs alike — is already HTTPS, so enforcing TLS closes the in-transit exposure gap with zero functional cost. There is no legitimate reason a FileBucket consumer needs plaintext S3 access, so this is a hard default rather than an option. Covered by the `enforces SSL` CDK test.

**D-FB-10: Versioning default ON — supersedes D-FB-6's opt-in default**
**Decision:** `versioned` now defaults to `true`; consumers opt out with the literal `versioned: false`. The version-aware runtime API and its option typings (`GetOptionsFor` et al.) remain unchanged in shape, but the conditional types now select the non-versioned (optionless) form only for the literal `versioned: false` — a non-literal `boolean` or an absent value resolves to the versioned-aware form, matching the new runtime default.
**Rationale:** Accidental overwrites and deletes are unrecoverable without versioning; defaulting it on makes the safe choice the default and matches the "secure by default" posture of D-FB-9. This is a **behavior/breaking change** for existing consumers (buckets that were non-versioned by default now enable versioning, which adds storage cost for prior versions), so it ships with a `minor` changeset bump under the pre-1.0 (0.x) convention that a minor signals a breaking change. The literal-`false` typing gate is a deliberate consequence of `extends { versioned: false }`: TypeScript cannot narrow a widened `boolean` to the `false` branch, so the versioned-aware typings are the safe fallback.

**D-FB-11: Opt-in server access logging with a dedicated locked-down log bucket**
**Decision:** `accessLogging: true` provisions a second, dedicated S3 bucket (all public access blocked, S3-managed encryption, `enforceSSL`) that receives the main bucket's server access logs under the `access-logs/` prefix. Logs expire via a lifecycle rule after `logRetentionDays` (default `DEFAULT_ACCESS_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS = 90`). `logRetentionDays` is validated at synth: when access logging is enabled, a non-positive or non-integer value throws — a degenerate `Duration.days(0)`/negative lifecycle would otherwise only surface at deploy. The value is inert (and therefore not validated) when `accessLogging` is off.
**Rationale:** Access logging is off by default because it has a real cost (extra bucket, log storage) and most consumers don't need an audit trail; making it opt-in keeps the default lean. The log bucket is kept **separate** from the data bucket so log delivery can't loop back onto the bucket being logged. Validating `logRetentionDays` at synth follows the same fail-fast principle as D-FB-8 (bucket name) and the CORS guard (D-FB-12): misconfiguration fails loud at synth, not minutes into a deploy.
**Update (superseded by D-FB-13):** The per-block `logRetentionDays` option was **removed**. Access-log retention is no longer configured per-block; it now derives from the framework-wide `scope.defaults.logRetention` (`RetentionDays.ONE_WEEK` in sandbox / `ONE_YEAR` in production; `RetentionDays.INFINITE` omits the expiry rule so logs are kept indefinitely). The `accessLogging` toggle itself likewise falls back to `scope.defaults.accessLogging` when not set per-block. The dedicated locked-down log bucket and its separation from the data bucket (the substance of this decision) are unchanged — only the *source* of the retention/enable posture moved from a per-block number to the stack `BlocksDefaults`. The synth-time validation that formerly guarded `logRetentionDays` no longer applies (there is no per-block retention input); the equivalent guard now lives on `noncurrentVersionExpirationDays` — see D-FB-14.

**D-FB-12: Wildcard-origin CORS + mutating method rejected at synth**
**Decision:** A CORS rule whose `allowedOrigins` includes `'*'` and whose `allowedMethods` includes a mutating method (`PUT`/`POST`/`DELETE`, the `MUTATING_CORS_METHODS` set) throws a synth-time `Error`. Wildcard + safe methods (`GET`/`HEAD`) is allowed; explicit origins + mutating methods is allowed.
**Rationale:** A wildcard origin on a state-changing method lets any website issue authenticated cross-origin writes/deletes against the bucket — a CSRF-shaped exposure. Rather than silently deploying it, FileBucket fails loud at synth with an actionable message pointing the developer at explicit origins. A hard error (not a warning) was chosen deliberately: this PR supersedes the prior behavior where such a rule deployed unchallenged, and the user opted for the strict gate over a soft warning.

**D-FB-13: Posture knobs route through the framework `BlocksDefaults` — supersedes the per-block `logRetentionDays` and the `sandboxMode`-context removal read**
**Decision:** `removalPolicy`, `accessLogging`, and access-log retention are resolved from the stack-wide `BlocksDefaults` model (exposed as `scope.defaults`) rather than from per-block day-numbers or a `sandboxMode` CDK context read. Each posture knob follows the framework's `options?.field ?? scope.defaults.field` contract (the same pattern `bb-kv-store` uses for `removalPolicy`/`deletionProtection`, and documented on the `Scope.defaults` getter in `@aws-blocks/core/cdk`):
- `removalPolicy` — an explicit per-block `'destroy'|'retain'` still wins; when omitted it falls back to `scope.defaults.removalPolicy` (`DESTROY` in the sandbox preset, `RETAIN` in production). This replaces the previous `sandboxMode`-derived removal.
- `accessLogging` — falls back to `scope.defaults.accessLogging` when not set per-block, so a production-postured stack can opt every FileBucket into logging without a per-block flag.
- **access-log retention** — derives from `scope.defaults.logRetention` (a `RetentionDays` enum: `ONE_WEEK` sandbox / `ONE_YEAR` production). `RetentionDays` is a numeric enum whose member value *is* the day count, so it maps directly to `Duration.days(...)`; the one non-day member `INFINITE` omits the lifecycle expiry rule (logs kept forever) rather than expiring at a spurious 9999 days.
**Rationale:** Addresses review comment (C): posture should come from the one stack-level model every block already consumes, not from a grab-bag of per-block numbers and a legacy `sandboxMode` context flag. Centralizing on `BlocksDefaults` means a stack picks `BlocksPresets.sandbox`/`.production` once and every FileBucket inherits a coherent removal + logging + retention posture, while per-block overrides remain available for the knobs that still accept them (`removalPolicy`, `accessLogging`). This also removes the last consumer of the `sandboxMode` context read from this package.

**D-FB-14: Noncurrent-version expiration bounded by default (90 days)**
**Decision:** When versioning is enabled (the default — D-FB-10), the main bucket gets a lifecycle rule (`ExpireNoncurrentVersions`) that permanently expires **noncurrent** object versions after `noncurrentVersionExpirationDays` (default `DEFAULT_NONCURRENT_VERSION_EXPIRATION_DAYS = 90`). The value's FORMAT is validated at synth whenever the option is provided, regardless of `versioned`: a non-positive or non-integer value throws (a degenerate `Duration.days(0)`/negative would otherwise only surface at deploy — same fail-fast principle as D-FB-8/D-FB-12). The rule itself is only APPLIED when versioning is on. There is no "disable" sentinel; to drop the rule entirely, disable versioning (`versioned: false`), which removes it along with versioning. The rule is inert on the mock and browser runtimes (no AWS resource).
**Rationale:** Addresses review comment (A): defaulting versioning ON (D-FB-10) makes overwrites/deletes recoverable but lets prior versions accrue storage cost without bound. Capping noncurrent versions at 90 days by default keeps the safe-by-default posture affordable — the common case (recover from a recent bad write) is well within 90 days, while stale versions no longer pile up indefinitely. It pairs with, and offsets the cost concern raised by, the versioning-default-on change rather than reopening that decision.

**D-FB-15: Identity access is resource-defined and request-scoped**
**Decision:** `identityAccess` grants FileBucket's own operation names to an
authenticated or guest identity role, with optional `*` and `${identityId}`
object-key patterns. `get` requires one or more slash-delimited prefixes
ending in `/*` for its missing-object probe. `scan` and `listVersions` can be
explicitly granted without key patterns; when patterned, they also require
slash-delimited prefixes ending in `/*`. Other operations can use an omitted
or broader pattern. After explicit `assumeForIdentity(context)`, the mock checks
the grant locally. In AWS, the call creates a fresh S3 client from the selected
temporary credentials and relies on the synthesized IAM role policy for operation
and key enforcement. Without an assumption, a bound compute uses the ordinary
execution-role client; a failed or expired assumption cannot fall back to it.
For an `AccessDenied` from an unversioned assumed-identity `get`,
the runtime performs a `ListObjectsV2` probe with the requested key as its prefix and
returns `null` only when that exact key is absent. The CDK layer grants only
the selected identity role the mapped S3 actions, using object ARNs for object
operations and a bucket ARN with `s3:prefix` for list operations.
**Rationale:** Identity Pool binding belongs to the compute, while authorization
belongs to each resource. Keeping grants on FileBucket makes the method and key
contract visible at construction, prevents accidental guest access, and lets
the mock simulate the declared restrictions. A `ListBucket` condition on
an exact key such as `foo` would also authorize a listing of `foobar`;
requiring a slash-delimited prefix for listing operations prevents that
cross-prefix disclosure while allowing the existence probe that maintains
FileBucket's `get()` null-on-missing contract.
Each identity client is held until a download body is fully read or a URL is
signed, then destroyed; a signed URL remains valid independently for its
requested expiry.

## Infrastructure (CDK)

Creates a single S3 bucket (plus a dedicated log bucket when `accessLogging` is enabled):

- **Bucket name:** Derived from `scope.fullId` (the bucket id joined to its parent scope ids with `-`). Validated at synth against S3's naming rules — see D-FB-6.
- **Block public access:** All four settings enabled (BLOCK_ALL)
- **Encryption:** S3-managed keys (SSE-S3)
- **TLS:** Enforced unconditionally (`enforceSSL: true`) — a bucket policy denies any request where `aws:SecureTransport` is `false`. Not configurable. See D-FB-9.
- **Versioning:** Enabled by default (secure default); opt out via `options.versioned: false`. See D-FB-10. When on, a lifecycle rule expires noncurrent versions after `options.noncurrentVersionExpirationDays` (default 90, validated as a positive integer at synth) to bound version-storage cost. See D-FB-14.
- **Server access logging:** Enabled per-block via `options.accessLogging`, falling back to `scope.defaults.accessLogging` when omitted; when on, provisions a separate, locked-down log bucket whose logs expire after the stack posture's `scope.defaults.logRetention` (`ONE_WEEK` sandbox / `ONE_YEAR` production; `INFINITE` = no expiry). See D-FB-11 and D-FB-13.
- **CORS:** Configured from `options.corsRules` if provided. A wildcard origin (`'*'`) combined with a mutating method (PUT/POST/DELETE) is rejected at synth. See D-FB-12.
- **Lifecycle rules:** Configured from `options.lifecycleRules` if provided (merged with the noncurrent-version expiration rule above)
- **Removal policy:** Resolved from `options.removalPolicy` (`'destroy'|'retain'`) when set, else the stack posture default `scope.defaults.removalPolicy` (DESTROY sandbox / RETAIN production) — replacing the former `sandboxMode` context read. See D-FB-13.
- **Auto-delete objects:** Enabled when removal policy is DESTROY
- **Permissions:** `grantReadWrite` to the parent scope's handler automatically

## Mock Implementation

- Files stored on the local filesystem at `.bb-data/{scope.fullId}/` via `getMockDataDir()` from core.
- Internal data is segregated into sibling roots so it can never collide with user keys (see D-FB-2):
  - `content/{key}` — file body, byte-identical to what was written.
  - `meta/{key}.json` — sidecar metadata.
  - `versions/{key}/{versionId}` (+ `.json` sidecars, `__deleted__` marker) — version history.
- Path mapping for both the mock and the dev file-server is centralized in `paths.ts` so they stay in lockstep.
- Data persists across dev server restarts. Customers can wipe with `rm -rf .bb-data`.
- Presigned URLs are served by the dev file-server at `/.bb-file-bucket/{scope.fullId}/{path}?token=...`. The path segments are URL-encoded; the server decodes them and validates an HMAC token scoped to method, path, and expiry. The HMAC secret (`LOCAL_FILE_SECRET` in `tokens.ts`) is a **per-process random value** — the token-minting mock and the validating dev file-server share the same in-process module instance, so tokens are unforgeable without being a hardcoded, source-visible literal.
- Downloads are served with `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `Content-Disposition: attachment`. The stored body and its `Content-Type` are caller-controlled, so serving them inline would make the dev file-server a stored-XSS vector (an uploaded `text/html`/SVG payload executing in the app origin). Forcing a download + disabling MIME sniffing keeps local dev no weaker than S3-behind-CloudFront.
- `scan()` recursively walks only the `content/` root and yields every file it finds — no marker-based filtering — so user keys are unrestricted.
- The dev file-server's PUT handler delegates to the registered `FileBucket` instance (via a process-global registry) so uploads get versioning, key validation, and metadata. There is no direct-write fallback; an unregistered bucket fails loud with a 500.
- Key length validated against S3's 1,024-byte limit (warns, does not reject).
- Versioning fully supported: each `put` writes to `versions/{key}/v{n}`, delete without `versionId` places a `__deleted__` sentinel, `listVersions` reads the versions directory, `restoreVersion` copies an old version via `put`.

### Mock vs AWS Behavior Differences

| Behavior Difference | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|--------|------------|
| No lifecycle rules | Objects never expire or transition locally | No mitigation — lifecycle rules are a background S3 process |
| No CORS enforcement | Browser requests succeed regardless of origin locally | No mitigation — CORS is enforced by the browser + S3, not the mock |
| No storage classes | Transition rules have no effect locally | No mitigation — storage classes are a cost optimization |
| No multipart upload | Large files use simple write locally | No mitigation — mock uses `fs.writeFile` regardless of size |
| Presigned URLs are localhost-only | URLs only work against the local dev server | No mitigation — expected behavior for local development |
| No IAM evaluation | The mock simulates `identityAccess` grants after explicit assumption, but cannot prove AWS IAM policy evaluation | Check synthesized policies and verify deployed IAM separately when required |
| Filesystem path limits | Some OS path length limits differ from S3 key limits (1,024 bytes) | Mock validates key length and warns when it exceeds 1,024 bytes |
| Path-traversal keys rejected locally | The mock maps keys onto the real filesystem, so it rejects keys that escape the bucket's content root (e.g. `../escape.txt`). S3 has no filesystem and treats `..` as a literal key segment, so it accepts such keys. A pathological key containing `..` that "works" on S3 will throw `ValidationFailed` locally. | Intentional — the guard prevents a local key from clobbering files outside `.bb-data`. Avoid `..` segments in keys (also S3 best practice). Covered by `src/path-containment.test.ts`. |
| Non-atomic `put()` | On a versioned bucket, `put()` performs several separate `writeFileSync` calls (version body, version metadata, current body, current metadata, delete-marker cleanup). A crash or process kill mid-`put()` can leave torn state — a body with no metadata sidecar, or a version body with no `.json`. Real S3 `PutObject` is atomic per object. | No mitigation today — the filesystem layout has no transaction boundary. Acceptable for a dev mock (re-running `put()` heals it). See Open Question 4 (storage engine). |
| Monotonic version IDs | Mock uses `v1`, `v2`, ... vs S3's opaque IDs | No impact — customer code should treat version IDs as opaque strings |
| Content-Type signed into presigned PUT URLs | When `putUrl`/`createUploadHandle` are given a `contentType`, the AWS SDK signs `content-type` as a required header, so real S3 returns `403 SignatureDoesNotMatch` if the uploaded request's `Content-Type` differs from (or omits) the signed value. The dev file-server enforces the same check (`src/file-server.ts`) so an upload that would fail in prod also fails locally with 403, rather than silently succeeding. Uploads via `createUploadHandle().upload()` always send the signed header, so the typed-handle path round-trips in both environments. Covered by `src/file-server.test.ts`. |
| Adjacent slashes in keys collapsed | The mock maps keys onto the filesystem via `path.join`, which collapses `//` to `/` (e.g. a key built from a URL-shaped value like `uploads/https://issuer:sub/f.txt`). A later `scan({ prefix })` whose prefix still contains `//` won't match the stored single-slash path, so the file appears "missing" locally. S3 treats keys as opaque byte strings and preserves `//`, so the same prefix matches in production. | Avoid embedding raw URL-shaped values (e.g. an OIDC `userId` of `${iss}:${sub}`) directly in keys — `encodeURIComponent()` the segment first. See the FileBucket README best-practices note. |
