## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 1f8a412: FileBucket now validates object keys identically in local dev and on AWS. A key is rejected (`ValidationFailed`) on both paths when it is empty, has a leading slash, contains an empty path segment (interior `a//b` or trailing `a/`), contains ASCII control characters, or contains a `..`/`.` path segment. Previously this validation ran only in the local mock, so such a key was silently accepted on the AWS runtime.
  
  Behavior change: the AWS runtime previously performed no key validation, so these keys were accepted. After upgrading, `get`/`delete`/`listVersions`/`restoreVersion` and the URL/batch methods reject them. If an application already stored objects under such keys, re-key those objects before upgrading.

### Patch Changes

- fa0406b: Refactor: extract FileBucket's synth-time option guards (unsafe-CORS wildcard, `noncurrentVersionExpirationDays` format) into a shared `validation.ts` (`validateFileBucketOptions`) called by both the CDK and mock constructors. Previously each constructor carried a verbatim copy of the guards; a single source of truth keeps mock↔CDK parity from drifting. No behavior change — the same combinations are rejected with identical messages on both paths. Follows the `bb-app-setting` pattern (#584); refs #590.
- 251aed2: fix(bb-file-bucket): align unknown-`versionId` behavior between the mock and AWS
  
  On a versioned bucket, an unknown `versionId` diverged between runtimes. S3 does
  **not** signal an unknown `versionId` as `NoSuchVersion` (verified against real
  S3): an id it cannot resolve comes back as `InvalidArgument` ("Invalid version id
  specified") on `GetObject`/`DeleteObject` and `InvalidRequest` on `CopyObject`;
  `NoSuchVersion` is reserved for a well-formed id that no longer exists. The AWS
  runtime now normalizes all of these so the observable contract matches the mock:
  
  - `get()` — returns `null` for an unknown `versionId` (matching the mock and
    `get()`'s documented "null if it does not exist" contract), instead of throwing.
  - `delete()` — is a silent no-op for an unknown `versionId` (matching the mock),
    instead of throwing.
  - `restoreVersion()` — throws a clean, matchable `FileBucketErrors.VersionNotFound`
    (`NoSuchVersion`) via core's `blocksError` producer, so both `.name`
    (`isBlocksError(e, FileBucketErrors.VersionNotFound)`) and the `.message` agree
    across runtimes — instead of the raw S3 error, whose enumerable `$metadata`
    (request IDs, ARNs) would leak to the client on serialization.
  
  The raw S3 codes are folded only when a `versionId` was actually supplied, so an
  unrelated `InvalidArgument`/`InvalidRequest` still surfaces. Also adds the public
  `FileBucketErrors.VersionNotFound` constant, and encodes the caller-supplied
  `versionId` in `CopySource` (a value with `&`, `#`, `?`, or a space would
  otherwise corrupt the `x-amz-copy-source` header).
- 757d4a9: feat(core): forward the native client user-agent into the AWS SDK user agent
  
  Native runtimes send `x-blocks-user-agent: aws-blocks-<lang>/<version>` on the RPC
  request. `@aws-blocks/core` validates it against a strict grammar (length-capped,
  dropped silently when malformed), carries it per request in an `AsyncLocalStorage`,
  and exports `installClientUserAgent`, an SDK middleware that appends the validated
  token to the outgoing user agent. The 12 participating Building Blocks install it,
  so native attribution rides the SDK user-agent chain AWS service telemetry already
  counts. The Kotlin runtime already sends the header, so Kotlin
  callers are attributed as soon as this ships; Swift and Dart follow.
- a23b8d8: Stop leaking raw backend exception details in RPC error responses, while forwarding Building Block error names AND their BB-authored messages.
  
  `errorResponseFromCatch` sorts a caught throw into three cases: an `ApiError` crosses the wire verbatim (status, `message`, `name`, `retriable`); a Building Block error carrying the wire-safe brand forwards BOTH its BB `name` in `data.name` AND its BB-authored `message` (per D-003, the wire carries `name` alongside `message`), so `isBlocksError()` keeps matching on the client and the caller sees the real, actionable message ("Batch contains 150 payloads, exceeds the 100 limit"); and everything else — a driver/SDK exception, a bare `Error`, or a non-`Error` throw — collapses to a nameless generic `500` / `"Internal error"`. The full error (including `cause`) is still logged server-side in every case.
  
  The brand is a non-enumerable symbol stamped by core's new `brandBlocksError()` helper, and the serializer keys the name-and-message-forwarding decision on that brand rather than on `.name !== 'Error'`. Every Building Block that mints a named error now routes it through that one helper — core's `blocksError()`, each package's own local `blocksError()`, and the inline named-error sites across the runtime and mock layers — so a BB error keeps its `name` and message on the wire no matter which package or layer threw it. A raw driver exception whose class name happens to be non-generic (`PostgresError`, `DynamoDBServiceException`) is never branded, so neither its class name nor its raw message ever reaches the client.
  
  The load-bearing invariant, now that messages cross the wire: **a branded error's message must never embed raw driver/SDK text.** Two message-embedding sites are therefore given stable, BB-authored messages (`bb-kv-store` and `bb-distributed-table`'s item-too-large remaps, which previously copied DynamoDB's raw `err.message`), keeping the raw driver error only as `cause`.
  
  Re-tag paths are branded, with a stable message. The catch-all re-tag paths in `bb-data` (`wrapError` / `translatePgError`) and `bb-distributed-data` (`translateDsqlError`) — which classify a caught driver error as `QueryFailed` / `ConnectionFailed` — now build a fresh BRANDED error carrying the BB `name` and a stable BB message (e.g. "The database query failed"), keeping the raw driver error as `cause`. This preserves the client-side `isBlocksError(e, DatabaseErrors.QueryFailed | .ConnectionFailed)` retry contract the `bb-data` README teaches for auto-pause-resume, and — because the message is a stable BB string, not the driver's — a re-tagged error still never leaks driver internals over the wire. The 40001 / 23505 conflict paths already crossed as `ApiError` (409) with stable messages and are unchanged. Also branded in this pass: `bb-auth-oidc`'s `InvalidRelayError` (a class-field error not reached by the `.name =` sweep) and `bb-distributed-data`'s mock DDL-guard error (name `DsqlPermissionException`, the internal `DSQL_PERMISSION_ERROR_NAME`; now branded with a stable message, its name kept internal and mock-only, not a public `DistributedDatabaseErrors` constant).
  
  The two `bb-realtime` client-middleware `brandBlocksError` calls are commented as intentionally inert (a client-side subscription rejection matches on `err.name`, never routes through the server serializer). The realtime e2e's `ConnectionFailedException` assertions run against `channel.subscribe()` in-process on the client, not across the RPC serializer.
  
  ## Breaking change (why `@aws-blocks/core` is a minor)
  
  App code that throws a plain `Error('Todo not found')` from an API method now surfaces as a generic `500` / `"Internal error"` on the client instead of the raw message (a customer-defined `Error` also loses its `.name`). This is the intended safety net — an unbranded throw is treated as an unhandled internal error — but it changes client-visible behavior, so `@aws-blocks/core` ships as a minor (we are pre-1.0). To send a specific status, name, and message to the client, throw an `ApiError`:
  
  ```ts
  // before — message collapses to "Internal error" on the client
  throw new Error('Todo not found');
  
  // after — status, message, and name all reach the client
  throw new ApiError('Todo not found', 404, { name: 'TodoNotFoundException' });
  ```
  
  Building Block errors (`isBlocksError` / `blocksError`) are unaffected — their name and message continue to cross the wire.

### Patch Changes

- 5eee114: Add npm keywords for discoverability via `npm search keywords:aws-blocks`
  
  Every published package now carries an npm `keywords` array: the shared `aws-blocks`
  discovery tag plus 2–5 functional keywords describing the package's domain and the
  AWS services it uses (e.g. `realtime`, `websocket`, `pubsub` for `bb-realtime`;
  `ci-cd`, `pipelines`, `deployment` for `pipeline`). Metadata only — no runtime,
  API, or behavior change.
- 6496713: Simplify VPC implementation: replace `registerVpcEndpoint` (instanceof-based) with two explicit methods (`registerVpcGatewayEndpoint` / `registerVpcInterfaceEndpoint`), simplify `BlocksVpcOptions` to `{ network, subnets?, provisionEndpoints? }`, and strip persistent test VPC to bare minimum.
- 6496713: feat(core): constructor-forced VPC requirements, lazy VPC, and Database subnet control
  
  Continues the VPC review follow-ups (net-new, unreleased VPC feature).
  
  **Building Blocks declare VPC requirements via the constructor, not a method.**
  `BuildingBlockScope` is no longer abstract: its constructor takes the block's VPC
  requirements (a value, or a callback for values that depend on `fullId`) and
  registers them in a central per-stack registry. This keeps the compile-time
  forcing the previous `abstract getVpcRequirements()` provided — a block can't
  silently omit its requirements — without a standing method on every subclass, and
  gives the framework one place to read, deduplicate, and answer "does anything here
  need a VPC?". All Building Blocks were migrated to pass requirements to `super()`.
  
  **VPC is now a derived resource, not a hard prerequisite.** A block that cannot
  function without a VPC declares `requiresVpc: true`; when one is needed and the
  customer didn't bring their own, Blocks lazily creates a single shared VPC
  (generalizing the create-if-absent behavior `bb-data` already used for Aurora) and
  emits a notice about the NAT cost. Setting `defaults.vpc = { network }` remains the
  bring-your-own override.
  
  **`Database` accepts an optional `subnets` placement.** A CDK-free mirror of
  `ec2.SubnetSelection` (tier as a string, subnets by id) lets you steer where the
  Aurora cluster lands — for a bring-your-own VPC that lacks an isolated tier, or a
  compliance requirement to use specific subnets. Omit it to keep the default
  (prefer isolated, fall back to `private-with-egress`).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 1b66571: `FileBucket`: secure-by-default hardening. Several of these are **behavior/breaking changes** for existing consumers — because the package is pre-1.0 (0.x), this ships as a `minor` bump per the changesets convention that a `minor` signals a breaking change before 1.0.
  
  - **TLS enforced unconditionally.** Every provisioned bucket now sets `enforceSSL: true`, attaching a bucket policy that denies any request where `aws:SecureTransport` is `false`. Not configurable.
  - **Versioning defaults ON.** `versioned` now defaults to `true`; opt out with the literal `versioned: false`. **Breaking:** buckets that were previously non-versioned by default now enable versioning (prior versions accrue storage cost). The non-versioned option typings (no `versionId`) are selected only by the literal `versioned: false`; a non-literal `boolean` or an absent value resolves to the versioned-aware typings.
  - **Opt-in server access logging routed through stack posture.** New `accessLogging` option; when not set per-block it falls back to the stack `BlocksDefaults.accessLogging`. When enabled, a dedicated, locked-down log bucket (all public access blocked, S3-managed encryption, SSL enforced) receives the main bucket's access logs under the `access-logs/` prefix.
  - **Access-log retention follows the stack posture's `logRetention`.** Log expiration now derives from `BlocksDefaults.logRetention` (`ONE_WEEK` in sandbox / `ONE_YEAR` in production; `RetentionDays.INFINITE` keeps logs indefinitely) instead of a per-block day count. **Breaking (within this unmerged PR):** the per-block `logRetentionDays` option has been **removed** — access-log retention is no longer configured per-block.
  - **Removal policy routed through stack posture.** `removalPolicy` still accepts an explicit per-block `'destroy'|'retain'`; when omitted it now falls back to `BlocksDefaults.removalPolicy` (`DESTROY` in sandbox, `RETAIN` in production), replacing the previous `sandboxMode`-context behavior.
  - **New `noncurrentVersionExpirationDays` option** (default `90`). With versioning on (the default), noncurrent object versions are automatically expired after this many days to bound the storage cost that versioning would otherwise let grow unbounded. Must be a positive integer — a non-positive or non-integer value throws at synth. Disable versioning (`versioned: false`) to drop the rule entirely.
  - **Removed `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`** from the local dev file-server's CORS response headers (it should never have been sent for anonymous, token-scoped presigned-URL access).
  - **Wildcard-CORS + mutating method now throws at synth.** A CORS rule combining a wildcard origin (`'*'`) with a mutating method (`PUT`/`POST`/`DELETE`) is rejected at synth with an actionable error. **Breaking:** such rules previously deployed unchallenged. Specify explicit origins for mutating methods; wildcard + `GET`/`HEAD` remains allowed.
  - **Mock mirrors the CDK synth-time validation.** The local/unit `FileBucket` now reproduces the CDK's two synth-time guards verbatim — the noncurrent-version-expiration range check (positive-integer, validated regardless of `versioned`) and the wildcard-CORS/mutating-method guard — so local and unit runs fail the same way `cdk synth` would (mock↔cdk parity). Both are gated on `!bucket`, matching the CDK's external-bucket early-return.
  - **External `bucket` option documented as not receiving the secure defaults.** The `bucket` option's TSDoc and the README "Wrapping an Existing Bucket" section now state that a wrapped/existing bucket bypasses every secure default (`enforceSSL`, versioning/noncurrent expiration, access logging, `blockPublicAccess`, encryption, the wildcard-CORS guard) — the caller owns that bucket's posture.

### Patch Changes

- 309a236: refactor(bb): attach IAM grants to the shared execution role
  
  Data and auth blocks now grant permissions to the shared Blocks execution role
  (`this.executionRole`) instead of the handler function directly. Grants land on
  the same role the handler assumes, so the effective runtime permissions are
  identical — this decouples IAM wiring from the concrete Lambda function ahead of
  the multi-compute model.
  
  For `bb-distributed-data`, the DSQL endpoint and region now flow through the
  config registry (loaded into `process.env` at cold start, like every other
  block) rather than being set as direct handler environment variables, and the
  migration Lambda maps the shared execution role's ARN.

### Patch Changes

- bd59e60: Harden the local dev file server against stored XSS and token forgery. Downloads are now served with `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `Content-Disposition: attachment`, so an uploaded `text/html`/SVG payload can no longer execute inline in the app's origin. The HMAC secret used to sign presigned-URL tokens is now a per-process random value instead of a hardcoded, source-visible literal, so tokens can no longer be forged offline. Both the token-minting mock and the validating dev file server share the same in-process value, so local presigned-URL round-trips are unaffected.

### Patch Changes

- ba3bf7b: docs: add per-package DESIGN.md documents

  Adds a `DESIGN.md` to each building-block package describing its architecture, API surface, mock implementation, and key design decisions.

  - Each document is cross-checked against the current source so identifiers, environment variables, error names, and described behavior match the implementation.
  - Each `DESIGN.md` is listed in its package's `files` array so it ships on npm alongside `README.md`.
  - For consistency, `bb-auth-cognito`'s document lives at the package root like every other package.
  - Bumps the umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` package so its bundled `docs/` — assembled from these block READMEs at build time — republishes with a fresh version. Its packed content changes whenever the READMEs change, but the version was previously left untouched, which tripped the publish integrity guard.
