# FileBucket

File storage backed by Amazon S3.

**When to use:** You need to store, retrieve, or serve binary files — user uploads, generated reports, images, videos, or static assets.

**When NOT to use:** If you need structured key-value data with conditional writes, use `KVStore`. If you need queryable records with indexes, use `DistributedTable`.

## API

```typescript
const bucket = new FileBucket(scope, id, options?)
```

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `put(path, body, options?)` | `Promise<void>` | Upload a file. Overwrites any existing file at the path. |
| `get(path, options?)` | `Promise<FileContent \| null>` | Download a file. Returns `null` if absent. Pass `{ versionId }` on versioned buckets. |
| `delete(path, options?)` | `Promise<void>` | Delete a file. No-op if absent. Pass `{ versionId }` on versioned buckets to permanently delete a version. |
| `deleteBatch(paths)` | `Promise<void>` | Delete multiple files. Chunks internally at 1,000 keys. |
| `getUrl(path, options?)` | `Promise<string>` | Generate a presigned download URL. Accepts `versionId` on versioned buckets. |
| `putUrl(path, options?)` | `Promise<string>` | Generate a presigned upload URL. |
| `getFileHandle(path, options?)` | `Promise<FileDownloadClient>` | Get a download handle for browser-side use. Accepts `versionId` on versioned buckets. |
| `createUploadHandle(path, options?)` | `Promise<FileUploadClient>` | Get an upload handle for browser-side use. |
| `scan(options?)` | `AsyncIterable<FileInfo>` | List files. Use `prefix` to scope. |
| `listVersions(path)` | `Promise<FileVersionInfo[]>` | List all versions of a file (versioned buckets only). Newest first. |
| `restoreVersion(path, versionId)` | `Promise<void>` | Restore a previous version as the current version. |
| `FileBucket.fromExisting(bucketName)` | `ExternalBucketRef` | Wrap a pre-existing S3 bucket. |

### Options

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `versioned` | `boolean` | Enable S3 object versioning. **Default: `true`.** Pass `versioned: false` to opt out. Note: the version-aware method typings (`versionId` on `get`/`delete`/`getUrl`/`getFileHandle`) are selected only by the literal `versioned: false`; a non-literal `boolean` or an absent value resolves to the versioned-aware typings. |
| `noncurrentVersionExpirationDays` | `number` | Days after which **noncurrent** (superseded) object versions are permanently expired, bounding the storage cost that versioning would otherwise let grow unbounded. Only applies when versioning is enabled (the default). **Default: `90`.** Must be a positive integer — a non-positive or non-integer value throws at synth. There is no disable sentinel; to drop the rule entirely, disable versioning (`versioned: false`). Ignored by the mock and browser runtimes. |
| `corsRules` | `CorsRule[]` | CORS rules for browser-based access. See [CorsRule](#corsrule) for the wildcard-origin synth guard. |
| `lifecycleRules` | `LifecycleRule[]` | Lifecycle rules for automatic expiration or storage class transitions. |
| `accessLogging` | `boolean` | Enable S3 server access logging. **Default: falls back to the stack posture (`BlocksDefaults.accessLogging`)** when omitted — so a production-postured stack can opt every FileBucket into logging without a per-block flag. When enabled, a dedicated, locked-down log bucket is provisioned (all public access blocked, S3-managed encryption, SSL enforced) and the main bucket delivers its access logs there under the `access-logs/` prefix. Access logs expire automatically after the stack posture's `logRetention` (`ONE_WEEK` in sandbox / `ONE_YEAR` in production; `RetentionDays.INFINITE` keeps them indefinitely). Ignored by the mock and browser runtimes. |
| `identityAccess` | `IdentityResourceGrant<FileBucketOperation>[]` | Explicit identity-pool access grants for an identity-bound compute. Each grant names an access role (`'authenticated'` or `'guest'`), FileBucket methods, and optional object-key patterns. No grant is implicit, including for guests. |
| `bucket` | `ExternalBucketRef` | Wrap an existing S3 bucket instead of creating one. |
| `logger` | `ChildLogger` | Optional logger for internal operations. When omitted, a default error-level logger is created. |
| `removalPolicy` | `'destroy' \| 'retain'` | CDK removal behavior for the underlying S3 bucket. When omitted, it falls back to the stack posture default (`BlocksDefaults.removalPolicy` — `DESTROY` in sandbox, `RETAIN` in production); pass `'destroy'` or `'retain'` to set it explicitly per-block. `'destroy'` also enables `autoDeleteObjects` so the bucket can be emptied on teardown. Ignored by the mock and browser runtimes. |

All FileBucket-provisioned buckets **enforce TLS unconditionally** (`enforceSSL: true`) — CDK attaches a bucket policy denying any request where `aws:SecureTransport` is `false`, closing the in-transit exposure gap. This is not configurable.

### Identity-scoped access

Bind an IdentityPool to the parent compute for CDK grant generation. An API
method calls `await identityPool.assumeForIdentity(context)` before user-scoped
FileBucket operations. Subsequent calls use the selected identity's temporary
AWS credentials. The mock simulates `identityAccess` grants locally; AWS relies
on the synthesized IAM role policy. Calls without an assumption use the ordinary
handler client. `operations` uses the public method
names from `FileBucketOperation`: `put`, `get`, `delete`, `deleteBatch`,
`getUrl`, `putUrl`, `getFileHandle`, `createUploadHandle`, `scan`,
`listVersions`, and `restoreVersion`.

```typescript
const bucket = new FileBucket(scope, 'uploads', {
  identityAccess: [{
    access: 'authenticated',
    operations: ['put', 'get', 'getUrl', 'getFileHandle', 'delete'],
    keyPatterns: ['uploads/${identityId}/*'],
  }],
});
```

`keyPatterns` supports `*` and `${identityId}`. Omit it to allow the listed
operations for every object; use an explicit pattern to limit each identity to
its own prefix. A grant containing `get` requires one or more
slash-delimited prefix patterns ending in `/*`, such as
`uploads/${identityId}/*`. This lets FileBucket use a prefix-scoped S3 listing
to preserve `get()` returning `null` for a missing object without exposing
adjacent prefixes such as `uploads` and `uploads-private`. An explicit `scan`
or `listVersions` grant may omit `keyPatterns` for unrestricted listing. When
either has patterns, they must also end in `/*`: S3 checks the requested list
prefix, which could otherwise return adjacent keys. `scan` is constrained by
its requested `prefix`, and `listVersions` by its `path`. `getUrl` and
`getFileHandle` authorize their own operations and do not require a listing
grant. A failed or expired assumption fails with `IdentityPool.Unauthorized`.
For an assumed identity, the mock reports `IdentityPool.Forbidden` for a method
or key outside its grants; AWS evaluates the role policy and S3 prefix/ARN
restrictions. Presigned URLs and file handles use the selected credentials
when minted and remain usable through their selected expiry.

### PutOptions

| Option | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `contentType` | `string` | MIME type (e.g., `image/png`). Default: `application/octet-stream`. |
| `metadata` | `Record<string, string>` | Custom metadata key-value pairs. |
| `cacheControl` | `string` | Cache-Control header value. |

### CorsRule

CORS configuration for browser-based access. Supplied via the `corsRules` option.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `allowedOrigins` | `string[]` | Origins permitted to make cross-origin requests (e.g., `['https://app.example.com']`). |
| `allowedMethods` | `('GET' \| 'PUT' \| 'POST' \| 'DELETE' \| 'HEAD')[]` | HTTP methods permitted for cross-origin requests. |
| `allowedHeaders` | `string[]` | Optional. Request headers permitted in the actual request. |
| `exposedHeaders` | `string[]` | Optional. Response headers exposed to the browser. |
| `maxAge` | `number` | Optional. Seconds the browser may cache the preflight response. |

> **Wildcard origins and mutating methods:** a CORS rule that combines a wildcard origin (`'*'`) with a mutating method (`PUT`, `POST`, or `DELETE`) **throws at synth** — it would let any site issue state-changing cross-origin requests. Specify explicit origins (e.g. `['https://app.example.com']`) for mutating methods. A wildcard origin with only safe methods (`GET`/`HEAD`) is allowed.

### LifecycleRule

Lifecycle configuration for automatic expiration or storage-class transitions. Supplied via the `lifecycleRules` option.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `prefix` | `string` | Optional. Prefix filter — the rule applies only to keys starting with this prefix. Omit to apply to all objects. |
| `expirationDays` | `number` | Optional. Days after creation to expire (delete) objects. |
| `transitionToIaDays` | `number` | Optional. Days after creation to transition objects to Infrequent Access storage. |

### FileVersionInfo

Returned by `listVersions()` — one entry per object version, newest first.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `versionId` | `string` | The version identifier. |
| `lastModified` | `Date` | When this version was created. |
| `size` | `number` | Size in bytes. |
| `isCurrent` | `boolean` | Whether this is the current (latest) version. |

### Error Handling

`get()` returns `null` for a missing file — it does **not** throw `FileNotFound`. Check for null:

```typescript
const file = await bucket.get('missing.txt');
if (!file) {
  // file does not exist
}
```

`FileBucketErrors` are thrown by other operations and matched with `isBlocksError`:

| Constant | `error.name` | Thrown when |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| `FileBucketErrors.FileNotFound` | `NoSuchKey` | Surfaced by presigned-URL 404s etc. **Not** thrown by `get()`, which returns `null`. |
| `FileBucketErrors.FileTooLarge` | `EntityTooLarge` | File exceeds size limits. |

```typescript
import { isBlocksError } from '@aws-blocks/core';
import { FileBucketErrors } from '@aws-blocks/bb-file-bucket';

try {
  await bucket.restoreVersion('report.pdf', 'non-existent-version');
} catch (e: unknown) {
  if (isBlocksError(e, FileBucketErrors.FileNotFound)) {
    // source version does not exist
  }
  throw e;
}
```

## Examples

### Basic Put/Get

```typescript
const bucket = new FileBucket(scope, 'uploads');

export const api = new ApiNamespace(scope, 'api', (context) => ({
  async uploadFile(name: string, content: string) {
    await bucket.put(name, content, { contentType: 'text/plain' });
  },
  async getFile(name: string) {
    const file = await bucket.get(name);
    if (!file) return null;
    return { contentType: file.contentType, size: file.size };
  },
}));
```

### Presigned Upload URL

```typescript
const bucket = new FileBucket(scope, 'media');

export const api = new ApiNamespace(scope, 'api', (context) => ({
  async getUploadUrl(path: string) {
    const url = await bucket.putUrl(path, {
      expiresIn: 600,
      contentType: 'image/jpeg',
    });
    return { uploadUrl: url };
  },
}));
```

### Listing Files with Scan

```typescript
const bucket = new FileBucket(scope, 'reports');

export const api = new ApiNamespace(scope, 'api', (context) => ({
  async listReports(yearMonth: string) {
    const files: FileInfo[] = [];
    for await (const file of bucket.scan({ prefix: `reports/${yearMonth}/` })) {
      files.push(file);
    }
    return files;
  },
}));
```

### Batch Delete

```typescript
const bucket = new FileBucket(scope, 'tmp');

export const api = new ApiNamespace(scope, 'api', (context) => ({
  async cleanupTemp(paths: string[]) {
    await bucket.deleteBatch(paths);
  },
}));
```

### Wrapping an Existing Bucket

```typescript
const bucket = new FileBucket(scope, 'legacy', {
  bucket: FileBucket.fromExisting('my-existing-bucket'),
});
```

> **A wrapped bucket does not receive FileBucket's secure defaults.** When you supply `bucket`, FileBucket binds to the existing bucket as-is and returns early — none of the secure defaults it normally applies are applied: not `enforceSSL`, versioning / noncurrent-version expiration, server access logging, `blockPublicAccess`, encryption, nor the wildcard-CORS guard. You own that bucket's security posture; configure these on the bucket itself (or via its own CDK construct) before wrapping it.

### Versioned Bucket

Versioning is **on by default**, so the version-aware methods (`listVersions`, `restoreVersion`, and optional `versionId` on `get`/`delete`/`getUrl`/`getFileHandle`) are available without any option. Pass `versioned: false` to opt out (which also removes the `versionId` option typings). The example below passes `versioned: true` explicitly for clarity:

```typescript
const bucket = new FileBucket(scope, 'docs', { versioned: true });

export const api = new ApiNamespace(scope, 'api', (context) => ({
  async upload(name: string, content: string) {
    await bucket.put(name, content);
  },
  async getVersion(name: string, versionId?: string) {
    return await bucket.get(name, versionId ? { versionId } : undefined);
  },
  async listVersions(name: string) {
    return await bucket.listVersions(name);
  },
  async restore(name: string, versionId: string) {
    await bucket.restoreVersion(name, versionId);
  },
}));
```

### Access Logging

Opt in to S3 server access logging. A dedicated, locked-down log bucket is provisioned and access logs expire automatically after the stack posture's `logRetention` (`ONE_WEEK` in sandbox, `ONE_YEAR` in production):

```typescript
// Logs delivered to a separate locked-down bucket.
// Retention follows the stack posture's logRetention default — not a per-block option.
const bucket = new FileBucket(scope, 'uploads', {
  accessLogging: true,
});
```

## Best Practices

- Use path prefixes to organize files (e.g., `uploads/{userId}/`, `reports/`). If a segment can contain URL-shaped or special characters (e.g. an OIDC `userId` of `${iss}:${sub}` like `https://issuer:sub`), wrap it in `encodeURIComponent()` first — the local mock normalizes `//` in keys via the filesystem, so an un-encoded `//` makes `scan({ prefix })` miss the file locally even though it works against S3.
- Set `contentType` on `put()` to ensure correct MIME handling on download
- Use presigned URLs (`getUrl` / `putUrl`) for direct browser upload/download
- Prefer `scan({ prefix })` over unscoped `scan()` to limit enumeration cost
- For browser uploads/downloads returned from API methods, prefer `createUploadHandle`/`getFileHandle` over raw presigned URLs — they encode the fetch protocol into typed methods so the client can't misuse them
- Use `deleteBatch()` instead of looping `delete()` for bulk operations
- Versioning is **on by default**; noncurrent (superseded) versions are automatically expired after **90 days** (`noncurrentVersionExpirationDays`, default `90`) so version history doesn't grow storage cost unbounded. Tune the window per-block, or disable versioning (`versioned: false`) to drop the expiration rule along with versioning.

## Scaling & Cost (AWS)

- **Billing:** Per-request plus storage — no provisioned throughput
- **Latency:** First-byte latency typically 100–200 ms
- **Throughput:** Scales automatically, 5,500 GET and 3,500 PUT requests/second per prefix
- **Object size limit:** 5 TB per object
- **Cost:** ~$0.005 per 1,000 PUT requests, ~$0.0004 per 1,000 GET requests, ~$0.023/GB/month storage
- **Durability:** 99.999999999% (11 nines) across 3+ AZs

## Local Development

Mock data persists to disk at `.bb-data/{fullId}/` across dev server restarts. Internal data is segregated into sibling roots so it never collides with your keys: file bodies live under `content/`, metadata under `meta/`, and version history under `versions/`. Wipe with `rm -rf .bb-data`. Presigned URLs are served by the dev server at `/.bb-file-bucket/{fullId}/{path}?token=...`. Versioning is fully supported locally. Lifecycle rules and CORS have no effect locally.
