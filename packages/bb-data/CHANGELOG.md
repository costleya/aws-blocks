### Minor Changes

- 21443ba: fix(data): map optimistic-concurrency conflicts to JSON-RPC 409 (Conflict) instead of 500
  
  Optimistic-concurrency / conditional-write conflicts now surface to clients as
  JSON-RPC error **code 409 (Conflict)** instead of a generic **500**. Previously
  these conflicts were thrown as plain named `Error`s (or re-thrown raw driver
  errors), and the JSON-RPC serializer maps any non-`ApiError` to 500 — so a
  routine, expected conflict was indistinguishable from an internal server error.
  
  Each affected conflict is now an `ApiError` with `status: 409`, so on the client
  `error.status === 409`. The structured `error.name` is preserved end-to-end, so
  `isBlocksError(e, ...)` keeps matching by name on both server and client, and the
  existing typed error constants are unchanged:
  
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-kv-store` — a failed `ifNotExists` / `ifExists` /
    `ifValueEquals` write or delete (`KVStoreErrors.ConditionalCheckFailed`). The
    AWS runtime now also normalizes DynamoDB's raw `ConditionalCheckFailedException`
    on both `put` and `delete`, matching the mock.
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-distributed-table` — a failed `ifNotExists` / `ifExists` /
    `ifFieldEquals` condition (`DistributedTableErrors.ConditionalCheckFailed`),
    in both mock and AWS `put`/`delete`.
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-distributed-data` — a DSQL serialization failure / OCC
    conflict, SQLSTATE `40001` (`DistributedDatabaseErrors.SerializationFailure`),
    in both the mock and real engines.
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-data` — a serializable-isolation conflict, SQLSTATE `40001`
    (`DatabaseErrors.SerializationFailure`), across the PGlite, pg-client, and
    Data API engines.
  
  The `retriable` flag is scoped to genuine optimistic-lock conflicts: it is
  `true` for value/field-equals conflicts (`ifValueEquals` / `ifFieldEquals`) and
  the 40001 serialization failures, and omitted/`false` for existence/uniqueness
  assertions (`ifNotExists`, `ifExists`), where a blind identical retry would fail
  identically. Status (409) and `error.name` are unchanged in every case.
  
  This is a `minor` bump. Every package here is pre-1.0, where `minor` is this
  repo's signal for a change that can alter existing behavior: callers that
  branched on `error.status === 500` for these conflicts (or on the JSON-RPC error
  code) will now see `409`. Code that matches conflicts by name via
  `isBlocksError` — the documented pattern — is unaffected.
  
  `@aws-blocks/core` and `@aws-blocks/blocks` get a `patch` bump for a docs-only
  change: a clarifying sentence was added to the `ApiError.retriable` JSDoc
  (no behavior or API change).
- a47d71c: fix(data): map duplicate-key unique-constraint violations to JSON-RPC 409 (Conflict) instead of 500
  
  A duplicate-key / unique-constraint violation (SQLSTATE `23505`,
  `UniqueConstraintViolation`) now surfaces to clients as JSON-RPC error
  **code 409 (Conflict)** instead of a generic **500**. Previously the engine
  translators set `error.name` on the raw driver error and re-threw a plain named
  `Error`; the JSON-RPC serializer maps any non-`ApiError` to 500, so a routine,
  expected duplicate-key conflict was indistinguishable from an internal server
  error. This mirrors the `40001`/OCC → 409 mapping already established for these
  Blocks.
  
  Each affected conflict is now an `ApiError` with `status: 409`, so on the client
  `error.status === 409`. The structured `error.name` is preserved end-to-end, so
  `isBlocksError(e, DatabaseErrors.UniqueConstraintViolation)` (and the
  `DistributedDatabaseErrors` equivalent) keeps matching by name on both server and
  client; the typed error constants are unchanged.
  
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-data` — a duplicate-key violation (SQLSTATE `23505`,
    `DatabaseErrors.UniqueConstraintViolation`) across the PGlite, pg-client, and
    Data API engines (both the SQLState-parsed and message-matched Data API paths),
    routed through a shared `uniqueConstraintConflict()` helper.
  - `@aws-blocks/bb-distributed-data` — a DSQL duplicate-key violation (SQLSTATE
    `23505`, `DistributedDatabaseErrors.UniqueConstraintViolation`) in
    `translateDsqlError`, in both the mock and real engines.
  
  The conflict is **not** flagged `retriable`: a duplicate key is deterministic, so
  a blind retry of the same insert fails identically (unlike the `40001`
  serialization failures, which stay retriable). The client-visible message is a
  fixed, stable string; the raw driver text (which can name columns / constraints)
  is retained only as `cause` for server-side diagnostics. Genuine infrastructure
  errors (`ConnectionFailed`, `QueryFailed`) are unchanged and correctly stay 500,
  and the `SerializationFailure`/OCC paths are untouched.
  
  This is a `minor` bump. Both data packages are pre-1.0, where `minor` is this
  repo's signal for a change that can alter existing behavior: callers that
  branched on `error.status === 500` for these conflicts (or on the JSON-RPC error
  code) will now see `409`. Code that matches conflicts by name via
  `isBlocksError` — the documented pattern — is unaffected.
  
  `@aws-blocks/blocks` gets a `patch` bump because it re-exports `bb-data` and
  `bb-distributed-data` (satisfies the umbrella publish guard); no umbrella source
  changed.
  
  Fixes #508.

### Patch Changes

- 5eee114: Add npm keywords for discoverability via `npm search keywords:aws-blocks`
  
  Every published package now carries an npm `keywords` array: the shared `aws-blocks`
  discovery tag plus 2–5 functional keywords describing the package's domain and the
  AWS services it uses (e.g. `realtime`, `websocket`, `pubsub` for `bb-realtime`;
  `ci-cd`, `pipelines`, `deployment` for `pipeline`). Metadata only — no runtime,
  API, or behavior change.
- 6496713: Simplify VPC implementation: replace `registerVpcEndpoint` (instanceof-based) with two explicit methods (`registerVpcGatewayEndpoint` / `registerVpcInterfaceEndpoint`), simplify `BlocksVpcOptions` to `{ network, subnets?, provisionEndpoints? }`, and strip persistent test VPC to bare minimum.
- 6496713: fix(bb-data): place shared-VPC Aurora in the subnets the VPC actually has
  
  When `Database` runs inside a bring-your-own VPC, its Aurora cluster was pinned
  to `PRIVATE_ISOLATED` subnets. The VPC in every docs example
  (`new ec2.Vpc(app, 'AppVpc', { maxAzs: 2, natGateways: 1 })`) has no isolated
  tier, so following the documented setup and adding a `Database` failed synth
  with "no isolated subnet groups in this VPC."
  
  Aurora is reached over the RDS Data API (HTTPS via the interface endpoint), not
  a raw Postgres socket, so the placement tier does not affect reachability — it
  only has to be a tier the VPC actually has. The shared-VPC path now prefers the
  isolated tier when the VPC has one (keeping the DB off any NAT path) and falls
  back to `PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS` otherwise, via the VPC context's `selectSubnets`.
  The standalone path is unchanged — it still builds its own VPC with a dedicated
  isolated tier.
  
  This is a `patch` bump: pre-1.0, where this repo reserves `minor` for breaking
  changes. The behavior change only affects the shared-VPC path that previously
  failed synth, so it is strictly a fix. The umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` gets
  the same bump because it re-exports `Database`.
  
  Also adds `Template.fromStack` unit coverage for `finalizeVpc` in
  `@aws-blocks/core` — asserting the provisioned `AWS::EC2::VPCEndpoint` set, the
  gateway/interface dedup, and the always-on CloudWatch Logs + SSM endpoints —
  which previously had no test exercising the provisioning path.
- 6496713: feat(core): constructor-forced VPC requirements, lazy VPC, and Database subnet control
  
  Continues the VPC review follow-ups (net-new, unreleased VPC feature).
  
  **Building Blocks declare VPC requirements via the constructor, not a method.**
  `BuildingBlockScope` is no longer abstract: its constructor takes the block's VPC
  requirements (a value, or a callback for values that depend on `fullId`) and
  registers them in a central per-stack registry. This keeps the compile-time
  forcing the previous `abstract getVpcRequirements()` provided — a block can't
  silently omit its requirements — without a standing method on every subclass, and
  gives the framework one place to read, deduplicate, and answer "does anything here
  need a VPC?". All Building Blocks were migrated to pass requirements to `super()`.
  
  **VPC is now a derived resource, not a hard prerequisite.** A block that cannot
  function without a VPC declares `requiresVpc: true`; when one is needed and the
  customer didn't bring their own, Blocks lazily creates a single shared VPC
  (generalizing the create-if-absent behavior `bb-data` already used for Aurora) and
  emits a notice about the NAT cost. Setting `defaults.vpc = { network }` remains the
  bring-your-own override.
  
  **`Database` accepts an optional `subnets` placement.** A CDK-free mirror of
  `ec2.SubnetSelection` (tier as a string, subnets by id) lets you steer where the
  Aurora cluster lands — for a bring-your-own VPC that lacks an isolated tier, or a
  compliance requirement to use specific subnets. Omit it to keep the default
  (prefer isolated, fall back to `private-with-egress`).
- 6496713: fix(core): harden VPC integration — scoped endpoint SG, runtime-subnet validation, instructive subnet errors
  
  Second-pass hardening of VPC support based on review feedback.
  
  **Interface endpoints are no longer reachable from the whole VPC.** They now get
  a dedicated security group that allows 443 only from the Blocks Lambda SG, and
  the endpoints are created with `open: false` to suppress CDK's default
  "allow 443 from the entire VPC CIDR" rule. On a bring-your-own VPC this stops
  unrelated workloads from reaching every Blocks interface endpoint.
  
  **`VpcRequirements.subnetRole` is replaced by `requiresEgress`.** The old field
  was declared but never consumed. `requiresEgress` expresses a real, validated
  capability: whether the BB's parent runtime (the shared handler Lambda) must be
  able to reach the internet. `finalizeVpc` validates it against the runtime's
  actual placement and fails synth with an actionable message on a mismatch — it
  never relocates the runtime (that's the customer's explicit choice).
  `bb-distributed-data` (DSQL) declares `requiresEgress: true`, turning a
  previously silent runtime failure (DSQL in isolated subnets deploys clean, then
  every call times out) into a build-time error.
  
  **`VpcContext.selectSubnets` is now instructive.** It takes the requesting BB and
  verifies the VPC actually has the requested subnet tier, throwing a BB-named,
  actionable error instead of the opaque CDK "no subnet groups" error. It accepts
  an explicit `{ fallback }` so a BB can opt into graceful degradation (e.g. Aurora
  over the Data API works from `private-with-egress` when there is no isolated
  tier); the downgrade is never silent. `bb-data` uses this.
  
  **Other fixes:** Lambda placement now fails fast with an actionable error when a
  VPC has no private-with-egress tier and none was specified; `bb-data` drops its
  unused 5432 ingress rule (Aurora is reached over the RDS Data API, not a socket);
  removed `any` casts from the Lambda props and endpoint/CIDR handling; de-duplicated
  the VPC/non-VPC branches in `BlocksStack`.
  
  All pre-1.0 `patch` bumps — no breaking changes to shipped, consumed API
  (`subnetRole` had no consumers). The umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` re-exports the
  affected types.

### Patch Changes

- ed158cf: fix(bb-data): apply migrations to a scale-to-zero Aurora cluster instead of failing the deploy
  
  A `Database` configured with `minCapacity: 0` auto-pauses after ~5 minutes idle.
  The first Data API call of a deploy wakes the cluster and fails with
  `DatabaseResumingException` while it resumes, which made the migration custom
  resource fail and roll the stack back. Any deploy made more than ~5 minutes
  after the last database activity hit this — it was deterministic, not a race.
  
  The migration Lambda already retried with exponential backoff (1s → 30s, 8
  attempts) while Aurora was coming up, but two things kept the resume error out
  of that path:
  
  - `DataApiEngine` classified it as `QueryFailed`. Errors carrying no SQLState
    are classified by SDK exception name, and `DatabaseResumingException` was not
    in that list. It now maps to `ConnectionFailed`, alongside
    `ServiceUnavailableException` and `InternalServerErrorException`. Application
    code that queries a paused cluster sees the same, more accurate name — which
    is transient and safe to retry, unlike `QueryFailed`.
  - The Lambda's retry predicate only matched raw SDK error names, which the
    engine has already rewritten by the time the error reaches it. It now retries
    on `ConnectionFailed`, so a transient connection failure during a deploy is
    retried rather than failing the stack. The raw SDK names are still matched for
    errors raised outside the engine, and the retry log line now names the error.
  
  Backoff limits are unchanged: ~2 minutes total, against a resume that typically
  completes in well under a minute.
- c45eb92: Extend stack-wide `BlocksDefaults` (introduced in the Infrastructure Options work) with three additive fields, and adopt them across the Blocks-managed infrastructure. Each field is read independently via `option ?? scope.defaults.field` — a per-block option always wins, and no field is derived from another.
  
  `@aws-blocks/core/cdk` now adds to `BlocksDefaults` (and both `BlocksPresets`):
  
  - `logRetention: RetentionDays` — how long Blocks-managed CloudWatch log groups keep events. Preset sandbox `ONE_WEEK`, production `ONE_YEAR`.
  - `throttling: { rateLimit, burstLimit }` — request-rate limits applied to every Blocks API Gateway stage. Preset sandbox `200 / 400`, production `1000 / 2000`.
  - `accessLogging: boolean` — structured JSON access logs on every Blocks API Gateway stage. **Off by default in both presets** (opt-in), because enabling it mutates the account/region-level API Gateway CloudWatch role singleton.
  
  Also newly exported from `@aws-blocks/core/cdk`: the `BlocksThrottling` type and `ensureApiGatewayAccount()` (provisions the account-level API Gateway CloudWatch Logs role once per stack). `Scope` gains a `handlerLogGroup` getter for the shared handler log group.
  
  **Log retention** — Blocks-managed log groups now follow `defaults.logRetention` instead of AWS's infinite default: the shared handler Lambda (now owned by `BlocksStack`/`BlocksBackend` as `scope.handlerLogGroup`), the `bb-distributed-table` GSI-manager Lambdas, the `bb-distributed-data` DSQL migration Lambda, the `bb-data` Aurora migration Lambda, and the `bb-app-setting` secret-init Lambda. `bb-logger` reconfigures the shared handler group's retention — **only when an explicit per-Logger `retention` is set** (a bare `Logger` no longer writes it back, so it can't clobber another Logger's value) — rather than creating its own `/aws/lambda/<fn>` group. (Note: the framework `custom-resources.Provider` Lambdas these BBs wrap still use AWS's default retention — the L2 `Provider` exposes no log-group/retention override.)
  
  **Throttling** — applied to the core REST API stage and the `bb-realtime` WebSocket stage. On a WebSocket stage the throttle unit is messages/second across the connection.
  
  **Access logging** — when enabled, each stage writes structured JSON access logs to a dedicated CloudWatch log group (retention = `defaults.logRetention`, removal policy = `defaults.removalPolicy` so production **RETAIN**s the audit trail on teardown). The account-level API Gateway CloudWatch Logs role is provisioned once per stack and shared across stages.
  
  **⚠️ Behavior changes on upgrade:**
  - **Throttling now caps the core REST API and WebSocket stages.** Before this change these stages had no stage-level throttle (they ran at the API Gateway account default, ~10k rps). After upgrade, sandbox is capped at 200 rps / 400 burst and production at 1000 rps / 2000 burst. Apps serving above the production ceiling will see `429`s — raise it with a per-stack `throttling` override (`defaults: { ...BlocksPresets.production, throttling: { rateLimit, burstLimit } }`).
  - **The shared handler Lambda log group changes.** The handler previously logged to Lambda's auto-created `/aws/lambda/<fn>` group (infinite retention); it now logs to a framework-owned group with the default retention. On upgrade the old auto group is left orphaned in CloudWatch (unmanaged, still infinite) — delete it manually if you want its history/cost gone. Likewise a `bb-logger`-created retention group from a prior version is replaced.
  - **Access logging** is **opt-in (off in both presets)**. When enabled it requires the account-level API Gateway CloudWatch Logs role — an account/region-level singleton, so enabling it is safe for **one Blocks stack per region** (see `ensureApiGatewayAccount()` for the multi-stack teardown caveat). It defaults off (rather than on for production) so an upgrade never mutates that account-wide singleton without an explicit opt-in.
  - **`BlocksDefaults` gains three required fields** (`logRetention`, `throttling`, `accessLogging`). Apps that spread a `BlocksPresets` preset (the documented path) are unaffected; code that hand-rolls a literal `BlocksDefaults` object will need to add the new fields to compile.
  
  `bb-dashboard` now points its log widgets at the framework-owned handler log
  group (`scope.handlerLogGroup.logGroupName`) instead of reconstructing
  `/aws/lambda/<fn>` — the handler now writes to a dedicated group with a
  CDK-generated name, so the old convention would leave the "Recent Errors" /
  "Log Volume" widgets querying an empty group.
  
  Hosting adoption of these defaults (SSR REST API + compute log groups) ships in a separate change.

### Patch Changes

- 309a236: refactor(bb): attach IAM grants to the shared execution role
  
  Data and auth blocks now grant permissions to the shared Blocks execution role
  (`this.executionRole`) instead of the handler function directly. Grants land on
  the same role the handler assumes, so the effective runtime permissions are
  identical — this decouples IAM wiring from the concrete Lambda function ahead of
  the multi-compute model.
  
  For `bb-distributed-data`, the DSQL endpoint and region now flow through the
  config registry (loaded into `process.env` at cold start, like every other
  block) rather than being set as direct handler environment variables, and the
  migration Lambda maps the shared execution role's ARN.

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- 7b4c62d: Add infrastructure `defaults` chosen once at the app entry point, replacing the per-block `sandboxMode` logic and the `RemovalPolicies`/`SandboxDisableDeletionProtection` mixin dance for removal-policy and deletion-protection.
  
  `@aws-blocks/core/cdk` now exports `BlocksDefaults` and the `BlocksPresets.sandbox` / `BlocksPresets.production` starting points. `BlocksStack.create` / `BlocksBackend.create` take a required `defaults` prop; start from a preset and override individual fields with a spread. `defaults` is anchored on the owning `BlocksStack`/`BlocksBackend` (resolved by walking up the construct tree, like `handler`/`executionRole`), so multiple backends in one stack each keep their own posture. Building Blocks read the resolved values via `scope.defaults`, and a per-block option always wins (`option ?? scope.defaults.field`).
  
  Adopted across the stateful Building Blocks: `bb-kv-store`, `bb-data`, `bb-distributed-data`, `bb-distributed-table`, and `bb-knowledge-base` now take their removal policy and deletion protection from `defaults` instead of reading the `sandboxMode` context themselves. (`bb-distributed-table` reads `defaults` directly for now; a richer per-block `protection` override lands with #282.)
  
  The `create-blocks-app` scaffolding templates are updated to pass `defaults: sandboxMode ? BlocksPresets.sandbox : BlocksPresets.production` (replacing the `RemovalPolicies`/`SandboxDisableDeletionProtection` mixin), so newly-generated apps satisfy the required prop.
  
  **Breaking:** `BlocksStack.create` / `BlocksBackend.create` now require a `defaults` field — pass `BlocksPresets.sandbox` or `BlocksPresets.production` (typically `sandboxMode ? BlocksPresets.sandbox : BlocksPresets.production`). The previously-shipped experimental `hardening` prop and its `resolve*` helpers are removed; log-retention, API throttling, access-logging and point-in-time-recovery move into `defaults` in follow-up, per-feature changes.
- 6df9e2d: fix(data): declare the `data-common` TypeScript project reference in `bb-data` and `bb-distributed-data`
  
  Both packages depend on `@aws-blocks/data-common` in `package.json`, but neither
  listed it in its `tsconfig.json` `references`. Because `src/` ships in these
  tarballs, `data-common`'s declarations have to already exist for the compiler to
  resolve `@aws-blocks/data-common` — and nothing in the project-reference graph
  guaranteed that.
  
  Correct build order was therefore supplied by the position of `data-common` in
  the root `workspaces` array (index 8, ahead of `bb-data` at 10 and
  `bb-distributed-data` at 11) rather than by the dependency graph. Any build that
  does not follow that array order fails with:
  
  ```
  packages/bb-distributed-data/src/validation.ts(12,54): error TS2307:
    Cannot find module '@aws-blocks/data-common' or its corresponding type declarations.
  ```
  
  That was already reachable from the repo's own scripts: the former
  `npm run build:packages` resolved its `-w` targets in a different order and hit
  exactly this, which is why `scripts/agent-bench/steps/1-init-bench-app.sh`
  carried the comment "`build:packages` runs alphabetically and trips over
  bb-data". Adding the two missing references fixes the root cause, so build order
  now comes from the project-reference graph rather than from the ordering of the
  root `workspaces` array.
  
  No API, runtime, or packaged-output change — `tsconfig.json` is not in either
  package's `files`, so the published tarballs are unchanged.
- 3614a09: Bundle the migration lambdas through `blocksNodejsBundling()` so `import.meta.url` used anywhere in the bundled migration handler is shimmed to its CommonJS equivalent instead of throwing at Lambda load. Consistent with the backend handler; no behavior change for existing migration lambdas. Also documents in the README that `migrationsPath` is simplest as a path relative to your project root, and that `import.meta.url` inside the bundle resolves to the bundled output (not your source tree).
- e4b1498: Retry PGlite's WASM initialization on the intermittent `_pg_initdb` `unreachable` trap.
  
  PGlite defers `initdb` to the first query, which can trap with `unreachable` under memory pressure (notably on CI when several PGlite-backed dev servers boot concurrently) and kill the dev server mid-`runMigrations`. `PGliteEngine` (bb-data) and `DsqlMockEngine` (bb-distributed-data) now force initialization through a shared bounded retry (`initializePgliteWithRetry` in data-common) that closes the aborted WASM instance and boots a fresh one, so a transient init trap recovers instead of crashing the process.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 49b3bd9: Make the unconfigured-connection error in the Database runtime intent-aware. When neither an Aurora cluster is provisioned nor an external `connectionString` connection is supplied, the error now names both paths — the provisioned Aurora database (`BLOCKS_*_CLUSTER_ARN` / `SECRET_ARN`) and `Database.fromExisting({ connectionString })` for external databases (Supabase/Neon/etc.) — instead of surfacing an Aurora-only message.
- a584007: fix(data-common): defer getEngine() in createKyselyAdapter so adapters are safe at module scope

  `createKyselyAdapter()` eagerly called `db.getEngine()` at construction. Backend
  `index.ts` is also loaded during `cdk synth`, where the infra-only (cdk) builds of
  `DistributedDatabase` / `Database` expose no engine — so creating the adapter at
  module scope crashed synth with `db.getEngine is not a function`.

  - **data-common** — the adapter now passes a thunk (`() => db.getEngine()`) into
    the Kysely dialect and resolves the engine lazily on the first query (still
    memoized per connection, preserving the one-engine-per-transaction guarantee
    the handle-based transaction API relies on). Adapter creation is now
    side-effect free and safe at module scope. Public API and runtime behavior are
    unchanged.
  - **bb-distributed-data / bb-data** — the cdk builds gain a `getEngine()` that
    throws a clear, actionable message if a query is ever reached during synth,
    replacing the cryptic "is not a function".

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 09b94b8: Bump the Database block's Aurora PostgreSQL engine version from the retired `16.4` to `16.13`, and make the engine version configurable.

  AWS retired Aurora PostgreSQL `16.4` in us-east-1, after which `CreateDBCluster` failed with `Cannot find version 16.4 for aurora-postgresql`, blocking every deployment of a `Database` block. The default now points at the latest available `16.x` minor (`16.13`) for the longest deprecation runway.

  A new optional `postgresVersion` option on `DatabaseOptions` lets callers override the engine version (e.g. `postgresVersion: '16.13'`), so the next AWS retirement is a configuration change rather than a framework code fix. Overrides are validated at synth time (must be `MAJOR.MINOR`, e.g. `16.13`), so a malformed value fails fast with a clear error instead of an opaque `CreateDBCluster` failure.

  The `@aws-blocks/blocks` umbrella package receives a `patch` because its published `docs/` folder is assembled from sibling block READMEs at build time (`scripts/sync-block-docs.mjs`), so this `bb-data` README update changes `@aws-blocks/blocks` packaged content.

- 4a87ed1: Recover incomplete local PGlite data directories before opening the database so an interrupted first boot does not permanently prevent local dev startup.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- e839301: fix: stack-scope the external-DB connection-string SSM parameter to prevent multi-app collision

  The external-database connection string was stored in an SSM parameter named only
  by stage (`/blocks/{stage}/db-connection-string`), so two Blocks apps deployed to
  the same AWS account + region + stage computed the same name and silently
  overwrote each other's credentials.

  The parameter name is now stack-scoped (`/<stackName>-db-url`), derived from a
  single new `getStackName({ sandbox, projectRoot })` helper that is also the one
  place the CDK templates compute the stack name (replacing logic duplicated across
  templates). The same `dbConnectionParameterName(stackName)` — fed the stack name
  from `getStackName({ sandbox, projectRoot })` — is used
  by the pre-deploy writer (`ensureSecrets`) and by the `db pull` generated wiring at
  synth, so the written name and the read name are derived once, from committed
  config (`.blocks/config.json`) — never from the connection string — and cannot
  diverge. The name is computable before synth (enabled by the committed stackId from
  PR #51), so no post-deploy write-back or staging-copy machinery is needed.

  The previous stage-only parameter is orphaned and self-heals on the next deploy.

### Minor Changes

- 42fcbdf: Add an `ssl` option to external database connections and verify the server's TLS
  certificate by default.

  `fromExisting({ connectionString })` now accepts an `ssl` option and verifies the
  server certificate by default instead of silently disabling verification. The `ssl`
  option is a discriminated union — `{ rejectUnauthorized?: true; ca?: string } | { rejectUnauthorized: false }` —
  so the misleading `{ ca, rejectUnauthorized: false }` (a pinned CA that `pg` would
  ignore) is a compile-time error. A TLS 1.2 floor is enforced on every connection.
  `bb-data pull` prompts for your provider CA and commits it to
  `aws-blocks/database.ca.ts` (a public, non-secret cert bundled into the deployed
  function), so the generated connection is verified by default — including in the
  deployed Lambda — with no runtime configuration. `DATABASE_CA_CERT` (inline PEM or
  file path) overrides the committed cert. Without any CA, local dev falls back to a
  visible, editable `rejectUnauthorized: false`, while the **deployed function and
  non-interactive (CI) migrations fail closed** rather than running unverified. Local
  dev keeps the previous unverified default for self-signed local databases (now with
  a warning when `ssl` is omitted, since the deployed runtime verifies).

  Upgrade note: if you call `fromExisting({ connectionString })` **directly** (not via
  `db pull`-generated code) with no `ssl` option, the connection now verifies the
  server certificate. Providers that use a private CA (e.g. Supabase) require pinning
  it — pass `ssl: { ca }` (the certificate contents) — otherwise the connection will
  fail to validate. Pass `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }` to keep the previous
  behavior explicitly. `db pull`-generated apps are unaffected in default
  connectivity.

  CI note: the `bb-data` CLI and migration paths (migrate status, generate-types,
  baseline, external migrations) now **fail closed in non-interactive runs** (`CI`
  set, excluding `CI=false`/`0`) when no CA is available. If you run these in CI/CD,
  set `DATABASE_CA_CERT` to your provider CA (inline PEM or a file path); otherwise
  they will throw instead of connecting unverified. Interactive (local) runs keep the
  warned, encrypted-but-unverified fallback.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- ba3bf7b: docs: add per-package DESIGN.md documents

  Adds a `DESIGN.md` to each building-block package describing its architecture, API surface, mock implementation, and key design decisions.

  - Each document is cross-checked against the current source so identifiers, environment variables, error names, and described behavior match the implementation.
  - Each `DESIGN.md` is listed in its package's `files` array so it ships on npm alongside `README.md`.
  - For consistency, `bb-auth-cognito`'s document lives at the package root like every other package.
  - Bumps the umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` package so its bundled `docs/` — assembled from these block READMEs at build time — republishes with a fresh version. Its packed content changes whenever the READMEs change, but the version was previously left untouched, which tripped the publish integrity guard.
