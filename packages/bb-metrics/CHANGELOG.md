### Patch Changes

- a23b8d8: Stop leaking raw backend exception details in RPC error responses, while forwarding Building Block error names AND their BB-authored messages.
  
  `errorResponseFromCatch` sorts a caught throw into three cases: an `ApiError` crosses the wire verbatim (status, `message`, `name`, `retriable`); a Building Block error carrying the wire-safe brand forwards BOTH its BB `name` in `data.name` AND its BB-authored `message` (per D-003, the wire carries `name` alongside `message`), so `isBlocksError()` keeps matching on the client and the caller sees the real, actionable message ("Batch contains 150 payloads, exceeds the 100 limit"); and everything else — a driver/SDK exception, a bare `Error`, or a non-`Error` throw — collapses to a nameless generic `500` / `"Internal error"`. The full error (including `cause`) is still logged server-side in every case.
  
  The brand is a non-enumerable symbol stamped by core's new `brandBlocksError()` helper, and the serializer keys the name-and-message-forwarding decision on that brand rather than on `.name !== 'Error'`. Every Building Block that mints a named error now routes it through that one helper — core's `blocksError()`, each package's own local `blocksError()`, and the inline named-error sites across the runtime and mock layers — so a BB error keeps its `name` and message on the wire no matter which package or layer threw it. A raw driver exception whose class name happens to be non-generic (`PostgresError`, `DynamoDBServiceException`) is never branded, so neither its class name nor its raw message ever reaches the client.
  
  The load-bearing invariant, now that messages cross the wire: **a branded error's message must never embed raw driver/SDK text.** Two message-embedding sites are therefore given stable, BB-authored messages (`bb-kv-store` and `bb-distributed-table`'s item-too-large remaps, which previously copied DynamoDB's raw `err.message`), keeping the raw driver error only as `cause`.
  
  Re-tag paths are branded, with a stable message. The catch-all re-tag paths in `bb-data` (`wrapError` / `translatePgError`) and `bb-distributed-data` (`translateDsqlError`) — which classify a caught driver error as `QueryFailed` / `ConnectionFailed` — now build a fresh BRANDED error carrying the BB `name` and a stable BB message (e.g. "The database query failed"), keeping the raw driver error as `cause`. This preserves the client-side `isBlocksError(e, DatabaseErrors.QueryFailed | .ConnectionFailed)` retry contract the `bb-data` README teaches for auto-pause-resume, and — because the message is a stable BB string, not the driver's — a re-tagged error still never leaks driver internals over the wire. The 40001 / 23505 conflict paths already crossed as `ApiError` (409) with stable messages and are unchanged. Also branded in this pass: `bb-auth-oidc`'s `InvalidRelayError` (a class-field error not reached by the `.name =` sweep) and `bb-distributed-data`'s mock DDL-guard error (name `DsqlPermissionException`, the internal `DSQL_PERMISSION_ERROR_NAME`; now branded with a stable message, its name kept internal and mock-only, not a public `DistributedDatabaseErrors` constant).
  
  The two `bb-realtime` client-middleware `brandBlocksError` calls are commented as intentionally inert (a client-side subscription rejection matches on `err.name`, never routes through the server serializer). The realtime e2e's `ConnectionFailedException` assertions run against `channel.subscribe()` in-process on the client, not across the RPC serializer.
  
  ## Breaking change (why `@aws-blocks/core` is a minor)
  
  App code that throws a plain `Error('Todo not found')` from an API method now surfaces as a generic `500` / `"Internal error"` on the client instead of the raw message (a customer-defined `Error` also loses its `.name`). This is the intended safety net — an unbranded throw is treated as an unhandled internal error — but it changes client-visible behavior, so `@aws-blocks/core` ships as a minor (we are pre-1.0). To send a specific status, name, and message to the client, throw an `ApiError`:
  
  ```ts
  // before — message collapses to "Internal error" on the client
  throw new Error('Todo not found');
  
  // after — status, message, and name all reach the client
  throw new ApiError('Todo not found', 404, { name: 'TodoNotFoundException' });
  ```
  
  Building Block errors (`isBlocksError` / `blocksError`) are unaffected — their name and message continue to cross the wire.

### Patch Changes

- 5eee114: Add npm keywords for discoverability via `npm search keywords:aws-blocks`
  
  Every published package now carries an npm `keywords` array: the shared `aws-blocks`
  discovery tag plus 2–5 functional keywords describing the package's domain and the
  AWS services it uses (e.g. `realtime`, `websocket`, `pubsub` for `bb-realtime`;
  `ci-cd`, `pipelines`, `deployment` for `pipeline`). Metadata only — no runtime,
  API, or behavior change.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- 0491157: `Metrics`, `Tracer`, and `DistributedDatabase` now report `bbName`/`bbVersion` to `Scope`, so they appear in telemetry like every other Building Block.

  All three were listed in the umbrella's `aws-blocks.vendorize` map, so `scripts/generate-bb-names.mjs` had already generated them into `OFFICIAL_BB_NAMES` — but none passed `bbMeta` to `super()`, and `Scope` only records a block in its registry when `bbName` is set. Their entries in that set were therefore inert: `Scope.getRegisteredBlocks()` could never name them, so `product.buildingBlocks` under-reported them. Each package now carries the standard `prebuild` (`generate-version.mjs Metrics` / `Tracer` / `DistributedDatabase`), which generates the `BB_NAME`/`BB_VERSION` its constructor passes through — the same wiring the other blocks use.

  `bb-tracer` and `bb-distributed-data` ship distinct mock implementations (their default entry does not re-export the AWS class), so both `index.aws.ts` and `index.mock.ts` carry the change; `bb-metrics`'s mock re-exports the AWS class, so its single runtime change covers both conditions. CDK entry points are deliberately left alone — telemetry is reported by the runtime class, not the synth-time construct.

  This is a follow-up to #298 (`AuthBasic`/`Logger`), completing telemetry parity for every vendorized block whose runtime class extends `Scope`. `@aws-blocks/blocks` takes a `patch` because it re-exports all three; sibling releases stay inside its caret range, so `changeset version` would not bump it on its own. `@aws-blocks/core` needs no bump — all three names were already present in the generated `OFFICIAL_BB_NAMES`, so that file is byte-identical.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- ba3bf7b: docs: add per-package DESIGN.md documents

  Adds a `DESIGN.md` to each building-block package describing its architecture, API surface, mock implementation, and key design decisions.

  - Each document is cross-checked against the current source so identifiers, environment variables, error names, and described behavior match the implementation.
  - Each `DESIGN.md` is listed in its package's `files` array so it ships on npm alongside `README.md`.
  - For consistency, `bb-auth-cognito`'s document lives at the package root like every other package.
  - Bumps the umbrella `@aws-blocks/blocks` package so its bundled `docs/` — assembled from these block READMEs at build time — republishes with a fresh version. Its packed content changes whenever the READMEs change, but the version was previously left untouched, which tripped the publish integrity guard.
