# AWS Blocks

**Write your backend and frontend together — fully typed, runnable on your laptop, deployable to AWS unchanged.**

AWS Blocks is a backend framework built from **Building Blocks**: self-contained modules that each bundle a CDK construct, its AWS SDK integration, and a local mock. You compose blocks in one directory, export an API, and call it from your frontend with end-to-end type safety. No client generation, no glue code, no AWS account needed to start.

This package (`@aws-blocks/blocks`) re-exports every Building Block and the core primitives, so you import everything from one place:

```typescript
import { Scope, ApiNamespace, KVStore, AuthBasic } from '@aws-blocks/blocks';
```

- **Type-safe, end to end** — your frontend calls backend methods directly; types flow through automatically.
- **Local-first** — every block runs as an in-memory mock, so you build and test with zero cloud setup.
- **Deploys unchanged** — `npm run sandbox` swaps the mocks for real AWS services (DynamoDB, Aurora, S3, Lambda…). Same code.
- **Low ceremony, high ceiling** — common things are one line; when you need the underlying CDK construct or AWS SDK, it's right there.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx @aws-blocks/create-blocks-app my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev          # → http://localhost:3000  (mocks, no AWS account needed)
```

`--template <name>` picks a starter (`react`, `nextjs`, `backend`, …); see [`@aws-blocks/create-blocks-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-blocks/create-blocks-app).

## How it works

Your entire backend lives in one directory, `aws-blocks/`. You create blocks, then expose methods through an `ApiNamespace`:

```typescript
// aws-blocks/index.ts
import { Scope, ApiNamespace, KVStore } from '@aws-blocks/blocks';

const scope = new Scope('my-app');
const store = new KVStore(scope, 'cache');

export const api = new ApiNamespace(scope, 'api', (context) => ({
  async getValue(key: string) {
    return await store.get(key);
  },
  async setValue(key: string, value: string) {
    await store.put(key, value);
  },
}));
```

The frontend imports that API and calls it like a local function — fully typed, no fetch, no client codegen:

```typescript
// src/
import { api } from 'aws-blocks';

await api.setValue('greeting', 'hello');
const value = await api.getValue('greeting'); // typed: string | null
```

That's the whole model: **define blocks → export an API → import it on the frontend.** The transport (JSON-RPC over a single endpoint) is handled for you and is intentionally invisible.

## Adding auth and data

Blocks compose. Here's the same API gated behind authentication and backed by a queryable table:

```typescript
// aws-blocks/index.ts
import { Scope, ApiNamespace, AuthBasic, DistributedTable } from '@aws-blocks/blocks';
import { z } from 'zod';

const scope = new Scope('my-app');

const auth = new AuthBasic(scope, 'auth', { passwordPolicy: { minLength: 8 } });

const notes = new DistributedTable(scope, 'notes', {
  schema: z.object({ userId: z.string(), noteId: z.string(), text: z.string() }),
  key: { partitionKey: 'userId', sortKey: 'noteId' },
});

// Sign-up / sign-in endpoints, ready to wire to the frontend
export const authApi = auth.createApi();

export const api = new ApiNamespace(scope, 'api', (context) => ({
  async addNote(text: string) {
    const user = await auth.requireAuth(context);          // 401s if not signed in
    const noteId = crypto.randomUUID();
    await notes.put({ userId: user.username, noteId, text });
    return { noteId };
  },
  async listNotes() {
    const user = await auth.requireAuth(context);
    return await Array.fromAsync(notes.query({ where: { userId: { equals: user.username } } }));
  },
}));
```

> **Security:** every `ApiNamespace` method is a public internet endpoint with **no auth by default**. Gate a method by calling `auth.requireAuth(context)` (or `auth.requireRole(...)`) at the top. The local mock enforces nothing either — an ungated method passes every local check and still ships callable by anyone.

On the frontend, `@aws-blocks/blocks/ui` gives you provider-agnostic auth components, or drive `authApi` yourself:

```typescript
import { Authenticator, onAuthChange } from '@aws-blocks/blocks/ui';
import { authApi, api } from 'aws-blocks';

document.body.append(Authenticator(authApi));
onAuthChange(authApi, (user) => {
  if (user) api.listNotes().then(render);
});
```

## Building Blocks

Start from what you need:

- **Store data**
  - Simple key → value (caches, flags, user prefs) → `KVStore` (bb-kv-store)
  - Structured records with indexes and queries → `DistributedTable` (bb-distributed-table) — **default for most data**
  - Relational / SQL (joins, transactions) → see [Choosing a data block](#choosing-a-data-block) below
  - Files, blobs, uploads, static assets → `FileBucket` (bb-file-bucket)
  - A single config value or secret → `AppSetting` (bb-app-setting)
- **Authenticate users**
  - Username/password, prototypes/MVPs → `AuthBasic` (bb-auth-basic)
  - Cognito user pools, MFA, groups → `AuthCognito` (bb-auth-cognito)
  - External identity provider (OIDC) → `AuthOIDC` (bb-auth-oidc)
- **Run work outside the request/response**
  - Fire-and-forget background jobs → `AsyncJob` (bb-async-job)
  - Scheduled / recurring tasks → `CronJob` (bb-cron-job)
- **Push live updates to browsers** (chat, presence, dashboards) → `Realtime` (bb-realtime)
- **Build AI features**
  - Agent with tool use + conversation → `Agent` (bb-agent)
  - Semantic document retrieval (RAG) → `KnowledgeBase` (bb-knowledge-base)
- **Send transactional email** → `EmailClient` (bb-email-client)
- **Serve a raw HTTP endpoint** (webhook receiver, health check, redirect, non-JSON response) → `RawRoute` (core); everything else goes through `ApiNamespace` RPC
- **Observe and operate**
  - Structured logs → `Logger` (bb-logger)
  - Custom metrics → `Metrics` (bb-metrics)
  - Distributed traces → `Tracer` (bb-tracer)
  - Auto CloudWatch dashboard → `Dashboard` (bb-dashboard)

### Choosing a data block

Default to `DistributedTable` for your data models unless your domain specifically requires SQL engine capabilities.

Reach for one of the SQL blocks when you need to filter or join results across more than one related record, filter models on many dimensions with no preset hierarchy, store large objects, require transactions, or otherwise need the flexibility or familiarity of SQL that NoSQL does not offer.

If you need SQL, prefer `DistributedDatabase` for basic Postgres-compatible querying. Use `Database` specifically when you need a full (more expensive) Postgres implementation where the engine itself provides and enforces foreign keys, row level security, triggers, views, large transactions (more than 3,000 rows), or integration with an existing Postgres database. Note it carries an idle cost at minimum 0.5 ACU, or a cold start when scaling from zero, unlike the other two blocks.

## Building Block documentation

Every Building Block ships its docs inside the `@aws-blocks/blocks` package under `docs/<block>/`: each `docs/<block>/` folder contains that block's `README.md`, plus `API.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` where present. To read them, locate the bundled folder:

```bash
node -p "require('path').dirname(require.resolve('@aws-blocks/blocks/docs/README.md'))"
```

If resolution fails, fall back to `node_modules/@aws-blocks/blocks/docs`. That folder holds this guide (`README.md`), the framework's own `API.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` (version history — read when troubleshooting), plus one subfolder per block; the catalog below lists every block.

## Local development and deploying

| | `npm run dev` | `npm run sandbox` |
|---|---|---|
| Blocks run as | in-memory mocks | real AWS services |
| AWS account | not needed | required |
| Data | persists to `.bb-data/` (delete to reset) | lives in AWS |
| Use for | rapid iteration, tests | pre-production validation against real services |

> **Deploying needs AWS credentials.** `npm run dev` is fully local (no creds). `npm run sandbox` and `npm run deploy` provision real AWS resources, so configure credentials first — e.g. `aws configure sso` + `aws sso login`, or `aws configure` (verify with `aws sts get-caller-identity`). Use **least-privilege** credentials scoped to the services your blocks deploy — not broad `Administrator` access.

`npm run deploy` does a full production deploy; `npm run sandbox:destroy` tears the sandbox down. The same backend code runs in all three — blocks switch implementations automatically.

`npm run deploy` streams CloudFormation events to **stdout** as they happen, so `npm run deploy | tee deploy.log` shows live progress instead of going silent for minutes, and a deploy failure keeps its reason on **stderr** (that stays the place to grep for why a deploy failed). On POSIX the deploy also survives a stray reap: a single `SIGTERM`, or any `SIGHUP` — a closed terminal, a backgrounded `npm run deploy &` — logs a line and keeps streaming rather than abandoning a stack update CloudFormation is still applying. Press Ctrl-C, or send `SIGTERM` twice, to stop it. That signal resilience is POSIX-only: Windows has no process groups and no OS-delivered `SIGTERM`/`SIGHUP`, so there a kill on the process tree still ends the deploy.

## Testing

The fastest loop is calling your API through its typed import in `test/e2e.test.ts` — no browser, no mocking:

```typescript
import { test } from 'node:test';
import assert from 'node:assert';
import type { api as ApiType } from 'aws-blocks';

let api: typeof ApiType;
test.before(async () => { api = (await import('aws-blocks')).api; });

test('stores and reads back a value', async () => {
  await api.setValue('k', 'v');
  assert.equal(await api.getValue('k'), 'v');
});
```

Run with `npm run test:e2e`. Write the test first, iterate against mocks until it passes.

## Best practices

- **Export every API** — the frontend can only import what you `export` from `aws-blocks/index.ts`.
- **Validate with schemas** — pass a Zod/Valibot schema to data blocks for compile-time *and* runtime type safety.
- **Don't block the request** — use `AsyncJob` for anything slow; `submit()` returns a `jobId` immediately.
- **Guard against races** — use conditional writes (`ifNotExists`, `ifValueEquals`, `ifFieldEquals`) instead of read-modify-write.
- **Test locally first** — mocks behave like the real service; deploy once it's green.

## Common mistakes

- **Ungated endpoints** — methods are public unless you call `requireAuth`/`requireRole`. The local mock won't catch this for you.
- **Forgetting to export** — an `ApiNamespace` you don't export is invisible to the frontend.
- **`Database` when `DistributedTable` would do** — Aurora costs more and has cold starts; reach for SQL only when you need it.
- **Curling REST-style paths** — there is no `GET /api/getData`. All calls are JSON-RPC to a single `POST /aws-blocks/api`; use the typed import instead.

## Security Considerations

- Use `await auth.requireAuth(context)` in every method that shouldn't be public — ApiNamespace methods are **unauthenticated by default**
- Use `new AppSetting(scope, id, { secret: true })` for API keys and credentials — never hardcode or use `.env` files
- Always attach a schema to KVStore/AppSetting that accepts user data — the RPC layer validates structure but not business logic
- Do not add broad `*` IAM policies — each Building Block already grants least-privilege scoped to its own resources
- Never change `blockPublicAccess` on FileBucket — serve public files through CloudFront instead
- Configure `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` explicitly for production — avoid wildcards
- For cross-domain deployments, pass `crossDomain: true` to auth constructors (enables `SameSite=None; Secure; Partitioned`)
- Enable `monitoring: { enabled: true, subscriptions: [new subs.EmailSubscription('oncall@example.com')] }` on Hosting for production alerts (`subs` = `aws-cdk-lib/aws-sns-subscriptions`; email/URL only)
- Add WAF and API Gateway throttling via CDK for public-facing apps — not included by default
- Logger provides serialization safety (circular refs, type coercion) but does NOT redact sensitive content — never pass raw credentials, tokens, or secrets to Logger methods; sanitize context objects before logging

## VPC Support

AWS Blocks supports running your backend in a VPC for network-level isolation or to connect to VPC-bound resources. You can let Blocks manage endpoint provisioning and security groups automatically, or bring a fully-configured VPC and handle networking yourself.

See [VPC.md](./VPC.md) for usage, configuration options, cost details, and guidance on when a VPC is appropriate.

## Reference

- **Per-block documentation:** `docs/<block>/README.md` (overview), plus `docs/<block>/API.md` (full API reference) and `docs/<block>/DESIGN.md` (architecture & rationale) where present — e.g. `docs/bb-distributed-table/README.md`. The catalog + decision tree live in `docs/README.md`.
- **UI components** (`@aws-blocks/blocks/ui`): `Authenticator`, `AuthenticatedContent`, `AccountMenuBar`, `onAuthChange`, `broadcastAuthChange` — framework-agnostic, return DOM nodes. See the `@aws-blocks/auth-common` README.
- **SSR** (`@aws-blocks/blocks/server`): `withAuth` forwards browser cookies to API calls during server rendering. See the `@aws-blocks/core` README.
- **Wire protocol & debugging:** the client is JSON-RPC 2.0 over a single endpoint — you should never call it directly. For `curl`-level troubleshooting, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
